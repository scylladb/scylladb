Scylla Gocql Extension 
==========================

The Scylla Gocqlx is an extension to gocql that provides usability features. 
With gocqlx, you can bind the query parameters from maps and structs, use named query parameters (``:identifier``), and scan the query results into structs and slices. 
The driver includes a fluent and flexible CQL query builder and a database migrations module.
