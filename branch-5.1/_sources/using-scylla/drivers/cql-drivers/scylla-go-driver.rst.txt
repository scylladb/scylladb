Scylla Go Driver
================

The `Scylla Go driver <https://github.com/scylladb/gocql>`_ is shard aware and contains extensions for a tokenAwareHostPolicy supported by Scylla 2.3 and onwards.
It is is a fork of the `GoCQL Driver <https://github.com/gocql/gocql>`_ but has been enhanced with capabilities that take advantage of Scylla's unique architecture.
Using this policy, the driver can select a connection to a particular shard based on the shardâ€™s token. 
As a result, latency is significantly reduced because there is no need to pass data between the shards. 

The protocol extension spec is `available here <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/master/docs/dev/protocol-extensions.md>`_. 
The Scylla Go Driver is a drop-in replacement for gocql. 
As such, no code changes are needed to use this driver. 
All you need to do is rebuild using the ``replace`` directive in your ``mod`` file.

**To download and install the driver**, visit the `Github project <https://github.com/scylladb/gocql>`_.


Using CDC with Go
-----------------

When writing applications, you can now use our `Go Library <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-cdc-go>`_ to simplify writing applications that read from Scylla CDC.
