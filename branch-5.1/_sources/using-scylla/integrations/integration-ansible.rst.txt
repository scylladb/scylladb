=============================
Install Scylla with Ansible
=============================

You can use the Ansible roles and the playbook examples that follow to deploy and maintain Scylla clusters.
There are roles for creating a Scylla cluster, a Scylla Manager, Scylla Monitoring Stack, and a Loader.
These roles can be used independently or together, using each role's outputs.
You can use these roles with Scylla (Open Source and Enterprise), Scylla Manager, and Scylla Monitoring Stack.
