JSON Support
------------

.. versionadded:: 2.3

Scylla introduces JSON support to :ref:`SELECT <select-statement>` and :ref:`INSERT <insert-statement>`
statements. This support does not fundamentally alter the CQL API (for example, the schema is still enforced). It simply
provides a convenient way to work with JSON documents.

SELECT JSON
^^^^^^^^^^^

With ``SELECT`` statements, the ``JSON`` keyword can be used to return each row as a single ``JSON`` encoded map. The
remainder of the ``SELECT`` statement behavior is the same.

The result map keys are the same as the column names in a normal result set. For example, a statement like ``SELECT JSON
a, ttl(b) FROM ...`` would result in a map with keys ``"a"`` and ``"ttl(b)"``. However, this is one notable exception:
for symmetry with ``INSERT JSON`` behavior, case-sensitive column names with upper-case letters will be surrounded with
double-quotes. For example, ``SELECT JSON myColumn FROM ...`` would result in a map key ``"\"myColumn\""`` (note the
escaped quotes).

The map values will ``JSON``-encoded representations (as described below) of the result set values.

INSERT JSON
^^^^^^^^^^^

With ``INSERT`` statements, the new ``JSON`` keyword can be used to enable inserting a ``JSON`` encoded map as a single
row. The format of the ``JSON`` map should generally match that returned by a ``SELECT JSON`` statement on the same
table. In particular, case-sensitive column names should be surrounded by double-quotes. For example, to insert into a
table with two columns named "myKey" and "value", you would do the following::

    INSERT INTO mytable JSON '{ "\"myKey\"": 0, "value": 0}'

By default (or if ``DEFAULT NULL`` is explicitly used), a column omitted from the ``JSON`` map will be set to ``NULL``,
meaning that any pre-existing value for that column will be removed (resulting in a tombstone being created).
Alternatively, if the ``DEFAULT UNSET`` directive is used after the value, omitted column values will be left unset,
meaning that pre-existing values for those columns will be preserved.


JSON Encoding of Scylla Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Where possible, Scylla will represent and accept data types in their native ``JSON`` representation. Scylla will
also accept string representations matching the CQL literal format for all single-field types. For example, floats,
ints, UUIDs, and dates can be represented by CQL literal strings. However, compound types, such as collections, tuples,
and user-defined types, must be represented by native ``JSON`` collections (maps and lists) or a JSON-encoded string
representation of the collection.

The following table describes the encodings that Scylla will accept in ``INSERT JSON`` values (and ``fromJson()``
arguments) as well as the format Scylla will use when returning data for ``SELECT JSON`` statements (and
``fromJson()``):

The fromJson() Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``fromJson()`` function may be used similarly to ``INSERT JSON``, but for a single column value. It may only be used
in the ``VALUES`` clause of an ``INSERT`` statement or as one of the column values in an ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``, or
``SELECT`` statement. For example, it cannot be used in the selection clause of a ``SELECT`` statement.

The toJson() Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``toJson()`` function may be used similarly to ``SELECT JSON``, but for a single column value. It may only be used
in the selection clause of a ``SELECT`` statement.
