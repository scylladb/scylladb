Contribute to Scylla
====================

Thank you for your interest in making Scylla better!
We appreciate your help and look forward to welcoming you to the Scylla Community.
There are two ways you can contribute:

* Send a patch to the Scylla source code
* Write documentation for Scylla Docs


Contribute to Scylla's Source Code
----------------------------------
Scylla developers use patches and email to share and discuss changes.
Setting up can take a little time, but once you have done it the first time, itâ€™s easy.

The basic steps are:

* Join the Scylla community
* Create a Git branch to work on
* Commit your work with clear commit messages and sign-offs.
* Send a PR or use ``git format-patch`` and ``git send-email`` to send to the list


The entire process is `documented here <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Contribute to Scylla Docs
-------------------------

Each Scylla project has accompanying documentation. For information about contributing documentation to a specific Scylla project, refer to the README file for the individual project.
For general information or to contribute to the Scylla Sphinx theme, read the `Contributor's Guide <https://sphinx-theme.scylladb.com/stable/contribute/>`_.
