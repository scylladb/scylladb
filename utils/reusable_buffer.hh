/* Sometimes (e.g. for compression), we need a big contiguous buffer
 * of a given size.
 *
 * Big buffers are a problem for the allocator, so if such a buffer
 * is needed regularly, we want to reuse it. In the optimum, we
 * only want to use one buffer per concurrent task (if all uses
 * of the buffer are synchronous, one buffer per shard is enough),
 * and only resize the buffer when it's too small for the current
 * request.
 *
 * At the same time we might not want to keep the buffer around forever.
 * A pathological request might cause the buffer to grow to some
 * unreasonable size. After the source of the pathology (e.g. bad compression
 * chunk size) is fixed, we want the buffer to free the capacity that will
 * most likely not be used again.
 *
 * This class provides a buffer which balances both tasks by periodically
 * shrinking its size to the largest recently seen size.
 * The buffer always has a power-of-2 size, to minimize the number of
 * allocations for small size changes.
 *
 * Even though the views returned by the buffer's methods have exactly the same
 * requested size, the entire underlying capacity (of size size()) is safe to use.
 * The returned views are always a prefix of the underlying capacity.
 *
 * Under a stable workload, the buffer's size will be stable.
 * If a pathological request comes, the buffer will grow to accommodate it.
 * 1-2 periods after the pathology ceases, the buffer will shrink back
 * to its steady-state size.
 *
 * Be very careful with this buffer.
 * Its content might disappear during a preemption point. This can be
 * checked by comparing reallocs() before and after the preemption point.
 * The content might be also easily invalidated by an unrelated future
 * sharing the same buffer, if you are not careful.
 *
 * To make this buffer slightly harder to misuse, it's only accessible
 * by reusable_buffer_guard.
 * There can only exist one guard at a time.
 * The guard can be used to obtain a view at most once.
