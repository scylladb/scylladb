/// Run the mutation query on all shards.
///
/// Under the hood it uses a multishard_combining_reader for reading the
/// range(s) from all shards.
///
/// The query uses paging. The read will stop after reaching one of the page
/// size limits. Page size is determined by the read_command (row and partition
/// limits) and by the max_size parameter (max memory size of results).
///
/// Optionally the query can be stateful. This means that after filling the
/// page, the shard readers are saved in the `querier_cache` on their home shard
/// (wrapped in a `shard_mutation_querier`). Fragments already read from
/// the shard readers, but not consumed by the results builder (due to
/// reaching the limit), are extracted from the `multishard_combining_reader`'s
/// (and the foreign readers wrapping the shard readers) buffers and pushed back
/// into the shard reader they originated from. This way only the shard readers
/// have to be cached in order to continue the query.
/// When reading the next page these querier objects are looked up from
/// their respective shard's `querier_cache`, instead of creating new shard
/// readers.
/// To enable stateful queries set the `query_uuid` field of the read command
/// to an id unique to the query. This can be easily achieved by generating a
/// random uuid with `utils::make_random_uuid()`.
/// It is advisable that the `is_first_page` flag of the read command is set on
/// the first page of the query so that a pointless lookup is avoided.
///
/// Note: params passed by reference are expected to be kept alive by the caller
/// for the duration of the query. Params passed by const reference are expected
/// to *not* change during the query, as they will possibly be accessed from
/// other shards.
