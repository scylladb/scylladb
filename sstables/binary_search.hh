/**
 * @returns: >= 0, if key is found. That is the index where the key is found.
 *             -1, if key is not found, and is smaller than the first key in the list.
 *          <= -2, if key is not found, but is greater than one of the keys. By adding 2 and
 *                 negating, one can determine the index before which the key would have to
 *                 be inserted.
 *
 * Origin uses this slightly modified binary search for the Summary, that will
 * indicate in which bucket the element would be in case it is not a match.
 *
 * For the Index entries, it uses a "normal", java.lang binary search. Because
 * we have made the explicit decision to open code the comparator for
 * efficiency, using a separate binary search would be possible, but very
 * messy.
 *
 * It's easier to reuse the same code for both binary searches, and just ignore
 * the extra information when not needed.
 *
 * This code should work in all kinds of vectors in whose's elements is possible to acquire
 * a key view via get_key().
