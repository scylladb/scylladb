Replace a Dead Node in a ScyllaDB Cluster 
******************************************

.. scylladb_include_flag:: upgrade-note-replace-node.rst

Replace dead node operation will cause the other nodes in the cluster to stream data to the node that was replaced. This operation can take some time (depending on the data size and network bandwidth).

This procedure is for replacing one dead node. You can replace more than one dead node in parallel.

-------------
Prerequisites
-------------

Quorum of Nodes
==================

.. include:: /operating-scylla/procedures/cluster-management/_common/quorum-requirement.rst

Verify the Node Status
=======================
Verify the status of the node you want to replace using the :doc:`nodetool status </operating-scylla/nodetool-commands/status>` command.

In the following example, the status of the node with the IP address 192.168.1.203 is 
Down (DN), and the node can be replaced.

.. code-block:: shell

   Datacenter: DC1
   Status=Up/Down
   State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
   --  Address        Load       Tokens  Owns (effective)                         Host ID         Rack
   UN  192.168.1.201  112.82 KB  256     32.7%             8d5ed9f4-7764-4dbd-bad8-43fddce94b7c   B1
   UN  192.168.1.202  91.11 KB   256     32.9%             125ed9f4-7777-1dbn-mac8-43fddce9123e   B1
   DN  192.168.1.203  124.42 KB  256     32.6%             675ed9f4-6564-6dbd-can8-43fddce952gy   B1

Remove the Data
==================

Log in to the dead node and manually remove the data if you can. Delete the data with the following commands:

.. include:: /rst_include/clean-data-code.rst

Collect Cluster Information
================================

Login to one of the nodes in the cluster with the UN status. Collect the following info from the node:

  * cluster_name - ``cat /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml | grep cluster_name``
  * seeds - ``cat /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml | grep seeds:``
  * endpoint_snitch - ``cat /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml | grep endpoint_snitch``
  * Scylla version - ``scylla --version``

---------
Procedure
---------

#. Install Scylla on a new node, see :doc:`Getting Started</getting-started/index>` for further instructions. Follow the Scylla install procedure up to ``scylla.yaml`` configuration phase. Ensure that the Scylla version of the new node is identical to the other nodes in the cluster. 

   .. include:: /operating-scylla/procedures/cluster-management/_common/match_version.rst

#. In the ``scylla.yaml`` file edit the parameters listed below. The file can be found under ``/etc/scylla/``.

    - **cluster_name** - Set the selected cluster_name
 
    - **listen_address** - IP address that Scylla uses to connect to other Scylla nodes in the cluster

    - **seeds** - Set the seed nodes

    - **endpoint_snitch** - Set the selected snitch

    - **rpc_address** - Address for client connection (Thrift, CQL)

#. Add the ``replace_node_first_boot`` parameter to the ``scylla.yaml`` config file on the new node. This line can be added to any place in the config file. After a successful node replacement, there is no need to remove it from the ``scylla.yaml`` file. (Note: The obsolete parameters "replace_address" and "replace_address_first_boot" are not supported and should not be used). The value of the ``replace_node_first_boot`` parameter should be the Host ID of the node to be replaced.

   For example (using the Host ID of the failed node from above):

   ``replace_node_first_boot: 675ed9f4-6564-6dbd-can8-43fddce952gy``

#. Start the new node.

   .. include:: /rst_include/scylla-commands-start-index.rst

#. Verify that the node has been added to the cluster using ``nodetool status`` command.

   For example:
    
    .. code-block:: shell
    
       Datacenter: DC1
       Status=Up/Down
       State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
       --  Address        Load       Tokens  Owns (effective)                         Host ID         Rack
       UN  192.168.1.201  112.82 KB  256     32.7%             8d5ed9f4-7764-4dbd-bad8-43fddce94b7c   B1
       UN  192.168.1.202  91.11 KB   256     32.9%             125ed9f4-7777-1dbn-mac8-43fddce9123e   B1
       DN  192.168.1.203  124.42 KB  256     32.6%             675ed9f4-6564-6dbd-can8-43fddce952gy   B1
    
    ``192.168.1.203`` is the dead node.
    
    The replacing node ``192.168.1.204`` will be bootstrapping data.
    We will not see ``192.168.1.204`` in ``nodetool status`` during the bootstrap.

    Use ``nodetool gossipinfo`` to see ``192.168.1.204`` is in NORMAL status.

    .. code-block:: shell

    After the bootstrapping is over, ``nodetool status`` will show:

    .. code-block:: shell

       State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving

#. Run the ``nodetool repair`` command on the node that was replaced to make sure that the data is synced with the other nodes in the cluster. You can use `Scylla Manager <https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/>`_ to run the repair.

    .. note:: 
       When :doc:`Repair Based Node Operations (RBNO) <repair-based-node-operation>` for **replace** is enabled, there is no need to rerun repair.


------------------------------
Setup RAID Following a Restart
------------------------------


In case you need to to restart (stop + start, not reboot) an instance with ephemeral storage, like EC2 i3, or i3en nodes,  you should be aware that:

   ephemeral volumes persist only for the life of the instance. When you stop, hibernate, or terminate an instance, the applications and data in its instance store volumes are erased. (see `https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/storage-optimized-instances.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/storage-optimized-instances.html>`_)

In this case, the node's data will be cleaned after restart. To remedy this, you need to recreate the RAID again.

#. Stop the Scylla server on the node you restarted. The rest of the commands will run on this node as well.

   .. include:: /rst_include/scylla-commands-stop-index.rst

#. Run the following command, remembering not to mount an invalid RAID disk after reboot:

   .. code-block:: none

      sudo sed -e '/.*scylla/s/^/#/g' -i /etc/fstab

#. Run the following command to replace the instance whose ephemeral volumes were erased (previously known by the Host ID of the node you are restarting) with the restarted instance. The restarted node will be assigned a new random Host ID.

   .. code-block:: none

      echo 'replace_node_first_boot: 675ed9f4-6564-6dbd-can8-43fddce952gy' | sudo tee --append /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml

#. Run the following command to re-setup RAID

   .. code-block:: none

      sudo /opt/scylladb/scylla-machine-image/scylla_create_devices

#. Start Scylla Server

   .. include:: /rst_include/scylla-commands-start-index.rst

Sometimes the public/ private IP of instance is changed after restart. If so refer to the Replace Procedure_ above.
