Integrate Scylla with MindsDB
===================================

`MindsDB <https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb>`_ is a machine learning platform to help developers build AI-powered solutions.  It helps automate and integrate machine learning frameworks (including `GPT-4 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4>`_) into the data stack as "AI Tables" to streamline the integration of AI into applications, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels. "AI tables" enable continuous learning from existing data.

MindsDB `integrates with ScyllaDB <https://docs.mindsdb.com/data-integrations/scylladb>`_ using a handler that is implemented using the scylla-driver Python library. 

You can find a `usage example <https://docs.mindsdb.com/data-integrations/scylladb>`_ in the documentation.
