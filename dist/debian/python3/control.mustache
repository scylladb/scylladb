Description: A standalone python3 interpreter that can be moved around different Linux machines
 This is a self-contained python interpreter that can be moved around
 different Linux machines as long as they run a new enough kernel (where
 new enough is defined by whichever Python module uses any kernel
 functionality). All shared libraries needed for the interpreter to
 operate are shipped with it.
