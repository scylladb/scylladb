// For each UDF full name and a scheduling group, we store a wasmtime instance

// can't be used in multiple continuations from the same scheduling group at the
// same time.
// The instance may be evicted only when it is not used, i.e. when the corresponding
// mutex is not held. When the instance is used, its size is not tracked, but
// it's limited by the size of its memory - it can't exceed a set value (1MB).
// After the instance stops being used, a timestamp of last use is recorded,
// and its size is added to the total size of all instances. Other, older instances
// may be evicted if the total size of all instances exceeds a set value (100MB).
// If the instance is not used for at least _timer_period, it is evicted after
// at most another _timer_period.
// Entries in the cache are created on the first use of a UDF in a given scheduling
// and they are stored in memory until the UDF is dropped. The number of such
// entries is limited by the number of stored UDFs multiplied by the number of
// scheduling groups.
