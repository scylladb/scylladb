    """ Test concurrent writes and column drop with CDC preimage enabled.

        This test reproduces an issue where writes concurrent with column drop can cause
        malformed SSTables when CDC preimage is enabled. The problem occurs because:

        1. The table has CDC with preimage='full', which means CDC preimage generation
           accesses all columns in the table, including ones not touched by the write
        2. Writes continuously update existing rows (triggering preimage generation)
        3. Concurrently, a column is dropped from the table
        4. The preimage generation may access the dropped column even though the actual
           write doesn't touch it
        5. This can result in writes having newer timestamps than the column drop
           timestamp, leading to malformed SSTables where dropped columns appear
           with data newer than their drop time

        The test validates that the resulting SSTables are well-formed by running
        compaction, which would fail if the SSTables were corrupted.
