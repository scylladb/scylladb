    The test starts 2 nodes, and thus, it creates 2 generations. Let's denote their timestamps by ts1 and ts2, where

    ts2 might already be much smaller than now after we finish adding the second node. Then, a write with a timestamp
    smaller than ts2 could unexpectedly fail because we reject writes to previous generations with timestamps not
    greater than (now - generation_leeway). To make this situation less likely, we increase ring-delay to 5 s, which
    increases ts2 by 15 s (see cdc::new_generation_timestamp). If this situation still happens, the test detects it and
    doesn't fail. We don't want to increase ring-delay more as it would slow down the test even more. To sum up, the
    test shouldn't be flaky, but there is no guarantee that it will always test what it's supposed to test. We also
    ignore it in debug mode due to the reasons above.
