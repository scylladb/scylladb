    Test the basic functionality of limited voters in a multi-DC cluster.

    Test that the limited voters feature works correctly during the upgrade.

    The scenario being tested here is that we first have a cluster that doesn't
    have the limited voters feature enabled, and then we enable it during the
    upgrade.

    We first upgrade all nodes except the coordinator, and then the coordinator
    itself. When the feature is not available on the coordinator, and would be
    enabled on the other nodes, the other nodes wouldn't become voters until the
    coordinator is upgraded as well. But that couldn't be done because the
    coordinator would be the last voter, thus the majority would be lost.

    Therefore we use the feature flags and only enable the feature after all
    nodes are upgraded (all nodes report that they support the feature).

        - create a 7-node cluster with the limited voters feature disabled
