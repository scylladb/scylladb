    """
    Test that the Raft-based recovery procedure works correctly with the user data. It involves testing:
    - client requests during the procedure (mainly availability),
    - removing/replacing dead nodes during the procedure in the presence of client requests and tablets on dead nodes.

    1. Start a cluster with two dcs, dc1 and dc2, containing three nodes each.
    2. Start sending writes with CL=LOCAL_QUORUM to a table with RF=3, NetworkTopologyStrategy and tablets.
    3. Kill all nodes from dc2 causing a permanent group 0 majority loss.
    4. Run the recovery procedure to recreate group 0 with nodes from dc2 as new members. Writes sent to dc1 should
    continue succeeding since at least two nodes are alive at any point during the recovery procedure (it involves only
    rolling restarts), every node in dc1 is a replica (3 nodes, RF=3) and two nodes make a local quorum in dc1.
    5. Remove nodes from dc2 from topology using remove or replace, depending on the value of the remove_dead_nodes_with
    parameter. For remove, we must do two additional steps to make it work:
    - Mark all dead nodes as permanently dead.
    - Decrease RF of the user keyspace, which uses tablets, to 0 in dc2.
    6. For remove, add 3 nodes to dc2 and bring back RF of the user keyspace to 3 in dc2, which brings back dc2 to its
    previous state. For replace, add a single node (a sanity check verifying that the cluster is functioning properly).
    7. Stop sending writes.
