    The reproducer for #14448.

    The test starts two nodes with different group0_ids. The second node
    is restarted and tries to join the cluster consisting of the first node.
    gossip_digest_syn message should be rejected by the first node, so
    the second node will not be able to join the cluster.

    This test uses repair-based node operations to make this test easier.
    If the second node successfully joins the cluster, their tokens metadata
    will be merged and the repair service will allow to decommission the second node.
    If not - decommissioning the second node will fail with an exception
    "zero replica after the removal" thrown by the repair service.
