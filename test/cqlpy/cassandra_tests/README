All tests in this directory and its subdirectories were translated from
Apache Cassandra's unit tests - the test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/cql3
directory in the Apache Cassandra source code repository.

The organization of this directory mirrors that of the Cassandra directory,
with test files renamed from SomeThingTest.java to some_thing_test.py.

Individual files were translated in their entirety, and each individual
file includes a comment on which version of the file was translated
(Cassandra's tests continue to evolve, so we may later want to catch up
with the differences).

Please avoid adding new tests, not translated from Cassandra, in this
directory. Instead, place new tests written from scratch for Scylla,
or improved tests, in the directory above.
