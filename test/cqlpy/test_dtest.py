# Tests translated from scylla-dtest's single-node tests.
#
# Many of scylla-dtest's tests started a cluster of just one node and ran
# CQL requests on it, so didn't need to be in dtest at all. Such tests that
# were not already covered by other tests in test/cqlpy were moved here.
# Running them here is much faster, and also lets us run them against
# Cassandra to check their assumptions.

# Test that a SELECT can list the same column more than once, and returns
# that column's value in each of these positions in the result.
# Reproduces issue #1367, where such a SELECT crashed Scylla on an assertion
# failure in cql3::result_set::add_row(), because the number of values in
# the row did not match the number of columns in the result's metadata.
# Translated from scylla-dtest's
# cql_additional_tests.py::TestCQL::test_select_duplicate_column.
