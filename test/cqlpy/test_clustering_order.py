# Tests for clustering key ordering, namely the WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY
# setting in the table schema, and ORDER BY in select.
#
# We have many other tests for this feature - in C++ tests, in translated
# unit tests from Cassandra (cassandra_tests), and its interaction with
# other features (filtering, secondary indexes, etc.) in other test files.
