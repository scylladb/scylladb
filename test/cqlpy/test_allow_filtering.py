# Tests for the "ALLOW FILTERING" specification on SELECT requests.
# ALLOW FILTERING is required in specific cases, but not required
# (but allowed) in other cases.
#
# Our documentation, https://docs.scylladb.com/getting-started/dml/, states
# that queries that do not need ALLOW FILTERING "have predictable
# performance in the sense that they will execute in a time that is
# proportional to the amount of data returned by the query (which can be
# controlled through LIMIT).".
#
# Note that we have several "xfail"ing tests below. They fail because in
# those cases Scylla does not live up to its own documented definition -
# either we don't require ALLOW FILTERING on a query that may produce only
# a few results and yet need to go over millions of partitions to produce
# them, or the opposite problem: a query which can be done in time
# proportional to the result size wrongly requires ALLOW FILTERING.
#
# Most of the tests below go beyond just checking whether ALLOW FILTERING
# is required: The tests also check that when the query is allowed, its
# results are the correct filtered subset of the entire content of the table.

# contents of the table ('everything') with the given 'filt' function.

# This test demonstrates a loose end after issue #9085 was fixed by PR #9122.
# The fix ensured correct results - but not correct ALLOW FILTERING need.
# In issue #9085, we have a query with a restriction on an indexed column plus
# the base table's partition key *and* a multi-column restriction on the
# compound clustering key. The incorrect results happened because the multi-
# column restriction was being ignored. The fix in PR #9122 was to apply the
# multi-column restriction as a "filtering" step. But this means we now
# require ALLOW FILTERING in this case, even when the query has a full
# prefix of the index table's clustering key.
# This test demonstrates how after PR #9122 we wrongly require ALLOW FILTERING
# in one such case.
# This test is basically the same as test_multi_column_with_regular_index in
# test_secondary_index.py, but it focuses on the correctness of the ALLOW
# FILTERING requirement, not just on the correctness of the results.
