# Test checks unexpected errors handling in CQL server.
#
# The original problem was that std::bad_alloc exception occurred while parsing a large batch request.
# This exception was caught by try/catch in cql_server::connection::process_request_one and
# an attempt was made to construct the error response message via make_error function.
# This attempt failed since the error message contained entire query and exceeded the limit of 64K
# in cql_server::response::write_string, causing "Value too large" exception to be thrown.
# This new exception reached the general handler in cql_server::connection::process_request, where
# it was just logged and no information about the problem was sent to the client.
# As a result, the client received a timeout exception after a while and
# no other information about the cause of the error.
#
# It is quite difficult to reproduce OOM in a test, so we use error injection instead.
# Passing injection_key in the body of the request ensures that the exception will be
# thrown only for this test request and will not affect other requests that
# the driver may send in the background.
