# exist, Scylla still needs to read the static column, but forgets to do so.
# this test reproduces this issue.

# mention a non-static column as well, suggests that Scylla has a different code
# path for the case that the condition has *only* static columns. In fact,
# in that case, the WHERE doesn't even need to specify the clustering key -
# the partition key should be enough. The following test confirms that this
