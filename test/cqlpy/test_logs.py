# Most cqlpy tests should limit themselves to the CQL API provided by
# the Cassandra Python driver, and should work when running against any CQL-
# compatible database, including Scylla and Cassandra, running locally or
# remotely. In particular, tests should generally *not* attempt to look at
# Scylla's log file - as this log file is completely different between
# Scylla and Cassandra, and not available at all when testing a remote server.
#
# Nevertheless, in some cases we might want to verify that some specific
# log messages do appear in Scylla's log file. These tests should be
# concentrated in this source file. All these tests are skipped when the
# test is not running against Scylla, or Scylla's log file cannot be
# found - e.g., because Scylla is running on a remote machine, or configured
# not to write to a log file).
#
# The code below automatically figures out where the log file is, when
# Scylla is running locally. First the local Scylla process is detected
# (it is the process listening to the our CQL connection, if we can find
# one), then its standard output is guessed to be the log file - and then
# we verify that it really is.

# should use the function-scope fixture "logfile" below, which takes care
# of opening the log file for reading in the right place.
