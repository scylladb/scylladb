# Tests for SELECT's LIMIT feature
#
# Note that LIMIT can be combined with many other features: GROUP BY,
# DISTINCT, CLUSTERING ORDER, aggregations, secondary indexes, paging,
# and more. So some tests involving a combination of these features are
# in other test files, not here:
# * LIMIT with GROUP BY (with and without aggregation) is tested in test_group_by.py
# * LIMIT with ORDER BY is in test_clustering_order.py
# * LIMIT with SELECT DISTINCT is in test_distinct.py
# * LIMIT with filtering is in test_secondary_index.py. Those tests check
#   that LIMIT should limit the number of post-filtering results, and run both
#   with and *without* a secondary index.
#
# As usual, all tests in this suite are run on a single node, so if we have
# bugs in the way that a coordinator aggregates results from multiple
# replicas, they are not tested here.
#
# All tests currently in this file only verify correctness - not performance:
# The tests don't check if the LIMIT is implemented efficiently (the replica
# stops reading after LIMIT rows) or in some inefficient manner (e.g., 1MB of
# data is read and then the excess data is dropped). We can consider later
# how to test performance aspects - perhaps using metrics.
