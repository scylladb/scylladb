# When averaging "decimal" (arbitrary-precision floating point) values,
# which precision should the output use? The average of 0, 0, 1 is
# 0.3333333333..., but with how many threes?
# The correct answer isn't clear. As explained in #13601 and CASSANDRA-18470,
# both Scylla and Cassandra took the number of significant digits in the
# average from the number of significant digits in the sum. So for example,
# the average of 1 and 2 is 2 (in Scylla, or 1 in Cassandra), but the average
# of 1.0 and 2.0 is 1.5. Similarly the average of 1.1 and 1.2 is 1.2 (or 1.1),
# not 1.15. This is surprising.
#
# Given that there is no way for the user to configure the desired precision,
# I don't know what would be a "correct" solution. I just feel that the
# scenarios tested in this test - averaging 1 and 2 or 1.1 and 1.2 -
# don't do something that any reasonable user might expect, and will need
# to be fixed.
