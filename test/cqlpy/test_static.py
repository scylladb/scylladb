# Test what happens when we SELECT a partition which has a static column

# Reproduces issue #10091.

# Marking this issue "xfail" because Scylla and Cassandra differ in behavior
# and we have no good explanation why Scylla's behavior is more correct than
# Cassandra. If we later decide that we consider *both* behaviors equally
# correct, we can change the test to accept both and make it pass.

    # If we select all the columns, including the static column s, SELECTing

    # But what happens if we SELECT just regular (non-static) columns?
    # Should the SELECT return nothing (since there is no clustering row),
    # or return one "row" with null columns (basically just like in the

    # Currently, Cassandra does the former, Scylla does the latter,

# clustering row will return it, but reading a *non-existing* row will not
# return anything - not even the static column.

# Contrast this with issue #10081 (test_lwt.py::test_lwt_missing_row_with_static)
# where we suggested that in an UPDATE with IF condition (LWT), the static
# columns should be readable in the condition expression, whether or not the
# given row exists.

# Verify that if a partition has a static column set, filtering it (with
# ALLOW FILTERING) based on regular columns will need to find clustering
# rows which actually match this filter - and can't return only a static
# row (which doesn't match the filter). This is similar to the previous test
# (test_missing_row_with_static) except that the filter here is on a regular
# column, not a clustering column.

# column value, and no clustering row at all. We expect to get back nothing
# when using a filtering on a regular column.
