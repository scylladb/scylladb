# we use a prepared statement, we can cause Scylla to store a frozen set in
# the wrong order, and therefore be unable to find it later via a different
# order.

# This demonstrates a strange side-effect of issue #7856: The Python driver
# does some unnecessary back-and-forth conversions of a frozen set used as
# a map key between a serialized string and a Python object, and gets
# confused when the frozen set is not correctly sorted and gets re-sorted
# by the serialization. In light of the simpler reproducer above in
# test_wrong_set_order_in_nested(), this one is unnecessary, but historically
# this was the first problem we noticed. Actually, this is a simplification
# of a problem in cassandra_tests/validation/entities/frozen_collections_test.py
# testNestedPartitionKeyUsage where we inserted set set as a Python frozenset()
# which does not use any specific order.
