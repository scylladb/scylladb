# Tests for data casts, e.g `SELECT CAST (... AS int) FROM tbl`
#
# Note that this is a different feature from the query casts `(int)123`
# which are tested separately in test_cast.py. Whereas the query casts
# can only reinterpret data losslessly (e.g., cast an integer to a wider
# integer), the data casts tested here can actually convert data from one
# type to another in sometimes surprising ways. For example, a very large
# arbitrary-precision number (varint) can be cast into an integer and result
# in a wraparound, or be cast into a float and result an infinity. In
# this test file we'll check some of these surprising conversions, and
# verify that they are the same in Scylla and Cassandra and don't regress.
#
# See also cql_cast_test.py in dtest.
