Tests for materialized views that need a three-node cluster.
Note that most materialized-view functional tests can make due with a single
node, and belong in cqlpy. We also have topology_experimental_raft/
test_mv_tablets.py for tests that each needs a cluster of a different
size, and/or special Scylla parameters.
