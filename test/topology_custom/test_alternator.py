# Please note that most tests for Alternator are single-node tests and can
# be found in the test/alternator directory. Most functional testing of the
# many different syntax features that Alternator provides don't need more

# - not just on Alternator, which the test/alternator framework allows to do.
# So only the minority of tests that do need a bigger cluster should be here.
