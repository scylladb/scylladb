# Tests for the different types of backup and restore features in

# Because we didn't implementing this feature yet (see issue #5063), this
# test suite is very partial.

# Oddly, as of May 2022, this can fail on AWS DynamoDB: Right after a
# table is created, it has continuous backups disabled - but a few seconds
# later, it suddenly reports that they are enabled! I don't know how to
# explain this, but I believe this is not a behavior we should reproduce.
