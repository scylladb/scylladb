# Tests for the DescribeTable operation.
# Some attributes used only by a specific major feature will be tested
# elsewhere:
#  1. Tests for describing tables with global or local secondary indexes
#     (the GlobalSecondaryIndexes and LocalSecondaryIndexes attributes)
#     are in test_gsi.py and test_lsi.py.
#  2. Tests for the stream feature (LatestStreamArn, LatestStreamLabel,
#     StreamSpecification) will be in the tests devoted to the stream
#     feature.
#  3. Tests for describing a restored table (RestoreSummary, TableId)
#     will be together with tests devoted to the backup/restore feature.
