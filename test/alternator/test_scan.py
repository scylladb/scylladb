# The following two tests reproduced issue #7933, where a scan encounters a
# long string of row/partition tombstones, and because it is expected to
# return a page in a constant amount of time, it should stop in the middle
# of long that string of tombstones.
# Before #7933 was fixed, there was no official threshold number of
# tombstones over which we know that paging must stop a page, so we could
# only demonstrate the bug asymptotically: If we have two live items with
# N consecutive tombstones between then, we know that there must be a large
# enough such N for which fetching the first page should return just the
# first live item - not both live items. If we try with arbitrarily large N,
# and the time to read the single page grows as O(N) but still always get
# two results - this is a bug.
# But now #7933 is fixed, and we do have an official threshold - configured
# by "query_tombstone_page_limit" and defaulting to 10,000. As soon as our
# test has more than this number of tombstones, we know the page must stop.
# So we can test that this indeed happens - without needing to reach huge
# sizes.
#
# In the first test, we create a single long partition with just two
# live items and a long contiguous string of row tombstones between them.
# A Scan of this partition should be able to stop in the middle of this
# string and *not* return both live items in a single page - because
# returning both live items takes an unbounded amount of time (proportional
# to the number of tombstones), and retrieving a single page must take a
# bounded amount of time. Reproduces issue #7933.
#
# This test is marked "scylla_only" because it doesn't really test something
# that *has* to happen - there is no reason in the DynamoDB API why reading
# a partition with a lot of deleted data must take a long time, or that if
# we do, that it will stop after a known number of tombstones. But we do
# expect this in Scylla's tombstone-based implementation - and in that
# implementation, and only in that implementation, we can require the scan
# to stop early, and also that we know when- after "query_tombstone_page_limit".
