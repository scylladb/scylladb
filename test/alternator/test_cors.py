# Tests for CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) protocol support.
# If the request has the "Origin" header specifying where the script which
# makes this request comes from, Alternator needs to reply with the header
# "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" saying that this (and any) origin is fine.
# Moreover, in a "preflight" request - with the OPTIONS method - the script
# can also "request" in headers that the server allows it to use some
# headers and HTTP methods in the followup request, and the server should
# respond by "allowing" them in the response headers.
