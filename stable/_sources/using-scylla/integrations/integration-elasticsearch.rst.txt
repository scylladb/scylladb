Integrate ScyllaDB with Elasticsearch
=====================================


ScyllaDB is Apache Cassandra compatible at the CQL binary protocol level, and any driver which uses CQL will work with ScyllaDB (more :doc:`here </using-scylla/drivers/index>`). Any application which uses a CQL driver will work with ScyllaDB.

The list below contains integration projects using ScyllaDB with Elasticsearch. If you have tested your application with ScyllaDB and want to publish the results, contact us using the `community forum <https://forum.scylladb.com>`_.
