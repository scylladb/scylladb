Integrate ScyllaDB with Presto
===============================

`Presto <https://github.com/prestodb/presto>`_, is an open-source distributed SQL query engine designed to run interactive analytic queries against various data sources. Facebook developed it, and it is now actively maintained by the Presto Software Foundation.

The blog post `Integrating ScyllaDB with a Presto Server for Data Analytics <https://www.scylladb.com/2023/08/28/integrating-scylladb-with-a-presto-server-for-data-analytics/>`_ goes over a hands-on example of integrating ScyllaDB, Presto, and `Metabase <https://github.com/metabase/metabase>`_ to provide an open-source data analytics solution for high-speed querying and user-friendly visualization.
