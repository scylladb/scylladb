=============================
Install ScyllaDB with Ansible
=============================

You can use the Ansible roles and the playbook examples that follow to deploy and maintain ScyllaDB clusters.
There are roles for creating a ScyllaDB cluster, a ScyllaDB Manager, ScyllaDB Monitoring Stack, and a Loader.
These roles can be used independently or together, using each role's outputs.
You can use these roles with ScyllaDB (Open Source and Enterprise), ScyllaDB Manager, and ScyllaDB Monitoring Stack.
