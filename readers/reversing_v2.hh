/// A reader that emits partitions in native reverse order.
///
/// 1. The reader's schema() method will return a reversed schema (see
///    \ref schema::make_reversed()).
/// 2. Static row is still emitted first.
/// 3. Clustering elements are emitted in reverse order.
/// 3. Range tombstones changes' tombstones are shifted by one to the left to
///    account for the implicit null tombstone at the start of the stream moving
///    from start to end (due to reversing).
/// Ordering of partitions themselves remains unchanged.
/// For more details see docs/dev/reverse-reads.md.
///
/// The reader's schema (returned by `schema()`) is the reverse of `original`'s schema.
///
/// \param original the reader to be reversed.
/// \param max_size the maximum amount of memory the reader is allowed to use
///     for reversing and conversely the maximum size of the results. The
///     reverse reader reads entire partitions into memory, before reversing
///     them. Since partitions can be larger than the available memory, we need
///     to enforce a limit on memory consumption. When reaching the soft limit
///     a warning will be logged. When reaching the hard limit the read will be
///     aborted.
/// \param slice serves as a convenience slice storage for reads that have to
///     store an edited slice somewhere. This is common for reads that work
///     with a native-reversed slice and so have to convert the one used in the
///     query -- which is in reversed format.
