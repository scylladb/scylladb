/// Make a foreign_reader.

/// foreign_reader is a local representant of a reader located on a remote
/// shard. Manages its lifecycle and takes care of seamlessly transferring
/// produced fragments. Fragments are *copied* between the shards, a
/// bufferful at a time.
/// To maximize throughput read-ahead is used. After each fill_buffer() or
/// fast_forward_to() a read-ahead (a fill_buffer() on the remote reader) is
/// issued. This read-ahead runs in the background and is brought back to
/// foreground on the next fill_buffer() or fast_forward_to() call.
/// If the reader resides on this shard (the shard where make_foreign_reader()
/// is called) there is no need to wrap it in foreign_reader, just return it as
/// is.
