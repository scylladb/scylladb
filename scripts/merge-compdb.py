# Called by configure.py to merge several compdbs into one, so your
# favourite compatible code indexer can present you with a relevant
# maximally-complete unified index.
#

# Usage: merge-compdb.py build/{debug,release,dev,sanitize} [input...]
#
# Glue inputs, which must be compdb ("compile_command.json") files,
# together, filtering out anything that is not indexable or not built
# under the given prefix, and write the result to stdout.
#
# An input is either a file name or "-" for stdin.
#
# configure.py calls this with "-" for the ninja-generated scylla
# compdb and mode-specific seastar & abseil compdbs.
#

# creates entries with an 'output' field _and_ needs to be filtered in
# the first place.
