// Read and write progress are provided by structures present in progress_manager.hh
// However, we don't want to be tied to their lifetimes and for that reason we will not
// manipulate them directly in the backlog manager.
//
// The structure that register those progress structures - the monitors - will let us know when does
// the sstable-side tracking structures go out of scope. And in that case we can do something about
// it.
//
// These objects lifetime are tied to the SSTable shared object lifetime and are expected to be kept
// alive until the SSTable is no longer being written/compacted. In other words, they are expected
// to be kept alive until one of compaction_backlog_tracker's add_sstable, remove_sstable or
// revert_charges are called.
//
// The reason for us to bundle this into the add_sstable/remove_sstable lifetime, instead of dealing
// with them separately and removing when the data transfer is done is that if we unregister a
// progrees manager and only later on add/remove the corresponding SSTable we can see large valley
// or peaks in the backlog.
//
// Those valleys/peaks originate from the fact that we may be removing/adding a fair chunk of
// backlog that will only be corrected much later, when we call add_sstable / remove_sstable.
// Because of that, we want to keep the backlog originating from the progress manager around for as
// long as possible, up to the moment the sstable list is fixed. The compaction object hosting this
// will certainly be gone by then.

// Keeping a static part for the backlog complicates the code significantly, though, so this will
