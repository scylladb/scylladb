====================================
Counting all rows in a table is slow
====================================

**Audience: ScyllaDB users**

Trying to count all rows in a table using

.. code-block:: cql

   SELECT COUNT(1) FROM ks.table;

may fail with the **ReadTimeout** error.

COUNT() runs a full-scan query on all nodes, which might take a long time to finish. As a result, the count time may be greater than the ScyllaDB query timeout. 
One way to prevent that issue in Scylla 4.4 or later is to increase the timeout for the query using the :ref:`USING TIMEOUT <using-timeout>` directive, for example:


.. code-block:: cql

   SELECT COUNT(1) FROM ks.table USING TIMEOUT 120s;

You can also get an *estimation* of the number **of partitions** (not rows) with :doc:`nodetool tablestats </operating-scylla/nodetool-commands/tablestats>`.

.. note::
    ScyllaDB 5.1 includes improvements to speed up the execution of SELECT COUNT(*) queries. 
    To increase the count speed, we recommend upgrading to ScyllaDB 5.1 or later. 
 

 .. REMOVE IN FUTURE VERSIONS - Remove the note above in version 5.1.
