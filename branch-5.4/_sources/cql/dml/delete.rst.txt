DELETE
^^^^^^

Deleting rows or parts of rows uses the ``DELETE`` statement:

.. code-block::
   
   delete_statement: DELETE [ `simple_selection` ( ',' `simple_selection` ) ]
                   : FROM `table_name`
                   : [ USING `update_parameter` ( AND `update_parameter` )* ]
                   : WHERE `where_clause`
                   : [ IF ( EXISTS | `condition` ( AND `condition` )* ) ]

For instance:

.. code-block:: cql

   DELETE FROM NerdMovies USING TIMESTAMP 1240003134000000
     WHERE movie = 'Serenity';

   DELETE phone FROM Users
     WHERE userid IN (C73DE1D3-AF08-40F3-B124-3FF3E5109F22, B70DE1D0-9908-4AE3-BE34-5573E5B09F14);

The ``DELETE`` statement deletes columns and rows. If column names are provided directly after the ``DELETE`` keyword,
only those columns are deleted from the row indicated by the ``WHERE`` clause. Otherwise, whole rows are removed.

The ``WHERE`` clause specifies which rows are to be deleted. Multiple rows may be deleted with one statement by using an
``IN`` operator. A range of rows may be deleted using an inequality operator (such as ``>=``).

``DELETE`` supports the ``TIMESTAMP`` option with the same semantics as the TIMESTAMP parameter used in the ``UPDATE`` statement.
The ``DELETE`` statement deletes data written with :ref:`INSERT <insert-statement>` or :ref:`UPDATE <update-statement>` (or :ref:`BATCH <batch_statement>`)
using a timestamp that is less than or equal to the ``DELETE`` timestamp.
For more information on the :token:`update_parameter` refer to the :ref:`UPDATE <update-parameters>` section.

In a ``DELETE`` statement, all deletions within the same partition key are applied atomically,
meaning either all columns mentioned in the statement are deleted or none.
If ``DELETE`` statement has the same timestamp as ``INSERT`` or
``UPDATE`` of the same primary key, delete operation prevails (see :ref:`update ordering <update-ordering>`).

A ``DELETE`` operation can be conditional through the use of an ``IF`` clause, similar to ``UPDATE`` and ``INSERT``
statements. Each such ``DELETE`` gets a globally unique timestamp.
However, as with ``INSERT`` and ``UPDATE`` statements, this will incur a non-negligible performance cost
(internally, Paxos will be used) and so should be used sparingly.

Please refer to the :ref:`update parameters <update-parameters>` section for more information on the :token:`update_parameter`.


Range deletions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Range deletions allow you to delete rows from a single partition, given that the clustering key is within the given range. The delete request can be determined on both ends, or it can be open-ended.

.. _open-range-deletions:


Open range deletions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open range deletions delete rows based on an open-ended request (>, <, >=, =<, etc.)

For example, suppose your data set for events at Madison Square Garden includes:


.. code-block:: none

   CREATE KEYSPACE mykeyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'}  AND durable_writes = true;
   use mykeyspace ;
   CREATE TABLE events ( id text, created_at date, content text, PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at) );
   
   INSERT into events (id, created_at, content) VALUES ('concert', '2019-11-19', 'SuperM');
   INSERT into events (id, created_at, content) VALUES ('concert', '2019-11-15', 'Billy Joel');
   INSERT into events (id, created_at, content) VALUES ('game', '2019-11-03', 'Knicks v Sacramento');
   INSERT into events (id, created_at, content) VALUES ('concert', '2019-10-31', 'Dead & Company');
   INSERT into events (id, created_at, content) VALUES ('game', '2019-10-28', 'Knicks v Chicago');
   INSERT into events (id, created_at, content) VALUES ('concert', '2019-10-25', 'Billy Joel');


   SELECT * from events;

    id      | created_at | content
   ---------+------------+---------------------
       game | 2019-10-28 |    Knicks v Chicago
       game | 2019-11-03 | Knicks v Sacramento
    concert | 2019-10-25 |          Billy Joel
    concert | 2019-10-31 |      Dead & Company
    concert | 2019-11-15 |          Billy Joel
    concert | 2019-11-19 |              SuperM

   (6 rows)

And you wanted to delete all of the concerts from the month of October using an open-ended range delete. You would run:

.. code-block:: none
  
   DELETE FROM events WHERE id='concert' AND created_at <= '2019-10-31';

   SELECT * from events;

    id      | created_at | content
   ---------+------------+---------------------
       game | 2019-10-28 |    Knicks v Chicago
       game | 2019-11-03 | Knicks v Sacramento
    concert | 2019-11-15 |          Billy Joel
    concert | 2019-11-19 |              SuperM
