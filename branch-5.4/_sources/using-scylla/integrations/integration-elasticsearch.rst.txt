===================================
Integrate Scylla with Elasticsearch
===================================


Scylla is Apache Cassandra compatible at the CQL binary protocol level, and any driver which uses CQL will work with Scylla (more :doc:`here </using-scylla/drivers/index>`). Any application which uses a CQL driver will work with Scylla.
