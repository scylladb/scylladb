===========================
Integrate Scylla with Spark
===========================


Scylla is Apache Cassandra compatible at the CQL binary protocol level, and any driver which uses CQL will work with Scylla (more :doc:`here </using-scylla/drivers/index>`). Any application which uses a CQL driver will work with Scylla.

The list below contains integration projects using Scylla with Spark. If you have tested your application with Scylla and want to publish the results, contact us using the `community forum <https://forum.scylladb.com>`_.
