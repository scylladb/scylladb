=========================================
Raft Consensus Algorithm in ScyllaDB
=========================================

Introduction
--------------
ScyllaDB was originally designed, following Apache Cassandra, to use gossip for topology and schema updates and the Paxos consensus algorithm for
strong data consistency (:doc:`LWT </using-scylla/lwt>`). To achieve stronger consistency without performance penalty, ScyllaDB has turned to Raft - a consensus algorithm designed as an alternative to both gossip and Paxos.

Raft is a consensus algorithm that implements a distributed, consistent, replicated log across members (nodes). Raft implements consensus by first electing a distinguished leader, then giving the leader complete responsibility for managing the replicated log. The leader accepts log entries from clients, replicates them on other servers, and tells servers when it is safe to apply log entries to their state machines.

Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger a leader election. All servers start as followers and remain in the follower state as long as they receive valid RPCs (heartbeat) from a leader or candidate. A leader sends periodic heartbeats to all followers to maintain his authority (leadership). Suppose a follower receives no communication over a period called the election timeout. In that case, it assumes no viable leader and begins an election to choose a new leader.

Leader selection is described in detail in the `Raft paper <https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf>`_.

ScyllaDB can use Raft to maintain schema updates in every node (see below). Any schema update, like ALTER, CREATE or DROP TABLE, is first committed as an entry in the replicated Raft log, and, once stored on most replicas, applied to all nodes **in the same order**, even in the face of a node or network failures.

Upcoming ScyllaDB releases will use Raft to guarantee consistent topology updates similarly.

.. _raft-quorum-requirement:

Quorum Requirement
-------------------

Raft requires at least a quorum of nodes in a cluster to be available. If multiple nodes fail
and the quorum is lost, the cluster is unavailable for schema updates. See :ref:`Handling Failures <raft-handling-failures>`
for information on how to handle failures.

Note that when you have a two-DC cluster with the same number of nodes in each DC, the cluster will lose the quorum if one
of the DCs is down.
**We recommend configuring three DCs per cluster to ensure that the cluster remains available and operational when one DC is down.**

.. _enabling-raft-existing-cluster:

Enabling Raft
---------------

.. note::
  In ScyllaDB 5.2 and ScyllaDB Enterprise 2023.1 Raft is Generally Available and can be safely used for consistent schema management.
  It will get enabled by default when you upgrade your cluster to ScyllaDB 5.4 or 2024.1.
  If needed, you can explicitly prevent it from getting enabled upon upgrade.

  .. only:: opensource

    See :doc:`the upgrade guide from 5.2 to 5.4 </upgrade/index>` for details.

ScyllaDB Open Source 5.2 and later, and ScyllaDB Enterprise 2023.1 and later come equipped with a procedure that can setup Raft-based consistent cluster management in an existing cluster. We refer to this as the **Raft upgrade procedure** (do not confuse with the :doc:`ScyllaDB version upgrade procedure </upgrade/index/>`).

.. warning::
    Once enabled, Raft cannot be disabled on your cluster. The cluster nodes will fail to restart if you remove the Raft feature.

To enable Raft in an existing cluster, you need to enable the ``consistent_cluster_management`` option in the ``scylla.yaml`` file 
for **each node** in the cluster: 

#. Ensure that the schema is synchronized in the cluster by executing :doc:`nodetool describecluster </operating-scylla/nodetool-commands/describecluster>` on each node and ensuring that the schema version is the same on all nodes.
#. Perform a :doc:`rolling restart </operating-scylla/procedures/config-change/rolling-restart/>`, updating the ``scylla.yaml`` file for **each node** in the cluster before restarting it to enable the ``consistent_cluster_management`` option:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       consistent_cluster_management: true

When all the nodes in the cluster and updated and restarted, the cluster will start the **Raft upgrade procedure**.
**You must then verify** that the Raft upgrade procedure has finished successfully. Refer to the :ref:`next section <verify-raft-procedure>`.

Alternatively, you can enable the ``consistent_cluster_management`` option when you are:

* Performing a rolling upgrade from version 5.1 to 5.2 or version 2022.x to 2023.1 by updating ``scylla.yaml`` before restarting each node. The Raft upgrade procedure will start as soon as the last node was upgraded and restarted. As above, this requires :ref:`verifying <verify-raft-procedure>` that the procedure successfully finishes.
* Creating a new cluster. This does not use the Raft upgrade procedure; instead, Raft is functioning in the cluster and managing schema right from the start.

Until all nodes are restarted with ``consistent_cluster_management: true``, it is still possible to turn this option back off. Once enabled on every node, it must remain turned on (or the node will refuse to restart).

.. _verify-raft-procedure:

Verifying that the Raft upgrade procedure finished successfully
========================================================================

The Raft upgrade procedure starts as soon as every node in the cluster restarts with ``consistent_cluster_management`` flag enabled in ``scylla.yaml``.

.. TODO: update the above sentence once 5.3 and later are released.

The procedure requires **full cluster availability** to correctly setup the Raft algorithm; after the setup finishes, Raft can proceed with only a majority of nodes, but this initial setup is an exception.
An unlucky event, such as a hardware failure, may cause one of your nodes to fail. If this happens before the Raft upgrade procedure finishes, the procedure will get stuck and your intervention will be required.

To verify that the procedure finishes, look at the log of every Scylla node (using ``journalctl _COMM=scylla``). Search for the following patterns:

* ``Starting internal upgrade-to-raft procedure`` denotes the start of the procedure,
* ``Raft upgrade finished`` denotes the end.

The following is an example of a log from a node which went through the procedure correctly. Some parts were truncated for brevity:

.. code-block:: console

    features - Feature SUPPORTS_RAFT_CLUSTER_MANAGEMENT is enabled
    raft_group0 - finish_setup_after_join: SUPPORTS_RAFT feature enabled. Starting internal upgrade-to-raft procedure.

    raft_group0_upgrade - synchronize_schema: finished.
    raft_group0_upgrade - Schema synchronized.
    raft_group0_upgrade - Raft upgrade finished.

In a functioning cluster with good network connectivity the procedure should take no more than a few seconds.
Network issues may cause the procedure to take longer, but if all nodes are alive and the network is eventually functional (each pair of nodes is eventually connected), the procedure will eventually finish.

Note the following message, which appears in the log presented above:

.. code-block:: console

    Schema changes are disabled in synchronize state. If a failure makes us unable to proceed, manual recovery will be required.

During the procedure, there is a brief window while schema changes are disabled. This is when the schema change mechanism switches from the older unsafe algorithm to the safe Raft-based algorithm. If everything runs smoothly, this window will be unnoticeable; the procedure is designed to minimize that window's length. However, if the procedure gets stuck e.g. due to network connectivity problem, ScyllaDB will return the following error when trying to perform a schema change during this window:

.. code-block:: console

    Cannot perform schema or topology changes during this time; the cluster is currently upgrading to use Raft for schema operations.
    If this error keeps happening, check the logs of your nodes to learn the state of upgrade. The upgrade procedure may get stuck
    if there was a node failure.

In the next example, one of the nodes had a power outage before the procedure could finish. The following shows a part of another node's logs:

.. code-block:: console

    raft_group0_upgrade - Entering synchronize state.
    raft_group0_upgrade - Schema changes are disabled in synchronize state. If a failure makes us unable to proceed, manual recovery will be required.
    raft_group0_upgrade - Waiting for all peers to enter synchronize state...

    ...
    raft_group0_upgrade - Raft upgrade procedure taking longer than expected. Please check if all nodes are live and the network is healthy. If the upgrade procedure does not progress even though the cluster is healthy, try performing a rolling restart of the cluster. If that doesn 't help or some nodes are dead and irrecoverable, manual recovery may be required. Consult the relevant documentation.
    raft_group0_upgrade - wait_for_peers_to_enter_synchronize_state: node 127.90.69.1 not in synchronize state yet...
    raft_group0_upgrade - wait_for_peers_to_enter_synchronize_state: retrying in a while...

.. TODO: the 'Consult the relevant documentation' message must be updated to point to this doc.

Note the following message:

.. code-block:: console

    raft_group0_upgrade - Raft upgrade procedure taking longer than expected. Please check if all nodes are live and the network is healthy. If the upgrade procedure does not progress even though the cluster is healthy, try performing a rolling restart of the cluster. If that doesn 't help or some nodes are dead and irrecoverable, manual recovery may be required. Consult the relevant documentation.

If the Raft upgrade procedure is stuck, this message will appear periodically in each node's logs.

The message suggests the initial course of action:

* Check if all nodes are alive.
* If a node is down but can be restarted, restart it.
* If all nodes are alive, ensure that the network is healthy: that every node is reachable from every other node.
* If all nodes are alive and the network is healthy, perform a :doc:`rolling restart </operating-scylla/procedures/config-change/rolling-restart/>` of the cluster.

One of the reasons why the procedure may get stuck is a pre-existing problem in schema definitions which causes schema to be unable to synchronize in the cluster. The procedure cannot proceed unless it ensures that schema is synchronized.
If **all nodes are alive and the network is healthy**, you performed a rolling restart, but the issue still persists, contact `ScyllaDB support <https://www.scylladb.com/product/support/>`_ for assistance.

If some nodes are **dead and irrecoverable**, you'll need to perform a manual recovery procedure. Consult :ref:`the section about Raft recovery <recover-raft-procedure>`.


Verifying that Raft is enabled
===============================

You can verify that Raft is enabled on your cluster by performing the following query on each node:

.. code-block:: sql

   cqlsh> SELECT * FROM system.scylla_local WHERE key = 'group0_upgrade_state';

The query should return:

   .. code-block:: console

     key                  | value
    ----------------------+--------------------------
     group0_upgrade_state | use_post_raft_procedures

    (1 rows)

on every node.

If the query returns 0 rows, or ``value`` is ``synchronize`` or ``use_pre_raft_procedures``, it means that the cluster is in the middle of the Raft upgrade procedure; consult the :ref:`relevant section <verify-raft-procedure>`.

If ``value`` is ``recovery``, it means that the cluster is in the middle of the manual recovery procedure. The procedure must be finished. Consult :ref:`the section about Raft recovery <recover-raft-procedure>`.

If ``value`` is anything else, it might mean data corruption or a mistake when performing the manual recovery procedure. The value will be treated as if it was equal to ``recovery`` when the node is restarted.

.. _raft-schema-changes:

Safe Schema Changes with Raft
-------------------------------
In ScyllaDB, schema is based on :doc:`Data Definition Language (DDL) </cql/ddl>`. In earlier ScyllaDB versions, schema changes were tracked via the gossip protocol, which might lead to schema conflicts if the updates are happening concurrently.

Implementing Raft eliminates schema conflicts and allows full automation of DDL changes under any conditions, as long as a quorum
of nodes in the cluster is available. The following examples illustrate how Raft provides the solution to problems with schema changes.

* A network partition may lead to a split-brain case, where each subset of nodes has a different version of the schema.

     With Raft, after a network split, the majority of the cluster can continue performing schema changes, while the minority needs to wait until it can rejoin the majority. Data manipulation statements on the minority can continue unaffected, provided the :ref:`quorum requirement <raft-quorum-requirement>` is satisfied.

* Two or more conflicting schema updates are happening at the same time. For example, two different columns with the same definition are simultaneously added to the cluster. There is no effective way to resolve the conflict - the cluster will employ the schema with the most recent timestamp, but changes related to the shadowed table will be lost.

     With Raft, concurrent schema changes are safe.



In summary, Raft makes schema changes safe, but it requires that a quorum of nodes in the cluster is available.

.. _raft-topology-changes:

.. only:: opensource

    Consistent Topology with Raft :label-caution:`Experimental`
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    ScyllaDB can use Raft to manage cluster topology. With Raft-managed topology 
    enabled, all topology operations are internally sequenced in a consistent 
    way. A centralized coordination process ensures that topology metadata is 
    synchronized across the nodes on each step of a topology change procedure. 
    This makes topology updates fast and safe, as the cluster administrator can 
    trigger many topology operations concurrently, and the coordination process 
    will safely drive all of them to completion. For example, multiple nodes can 
    be bootstrapped concurrently, which couldn't be done with the old 
    gossip-based topology.

    Support for Raft-managed topology is experimental and must be explicitly 
    enabled in the ``scylla.yaml`` configuration file by specifying 
    the ``consistent-topology-changes`` option:

    .. code:: 
    
        experimental_features:
        - consistent-topology-changes

    As with other experimental features in ScyllaDB, you should not enable this 
    feature in production clusters due to insufficient stability. The feature 
    is undergoing backward-incompatible changes that may prevent upgrading 
    the cluster. 

.. _raft-handling-failures:

Handling Failures
------------------
Raft requires a quorum of nodes in a cluster to be available. If one or more nodes are down, but the quorum is live, reads, writes,
and schema updates proceed unaffected.
When the node that was down is up again, it first contacts the cluster to fetch the latest schema and then starts serving queries.

The following examples show the recovery actions depending on the number of nodes and DCs in your cluster.

Examples
=========

.. list-table:: Cluster A: 1 datacenter, 3 nodes
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Failure
     - Consequence
     - Action to take
   * - 1 node
     - Schema updates are possible and safe.
     - Try restarting the node. If the node is dead, :doc:`replace it with a new node </operating-scylla/procedures/cluster-management/replace-dead-node/>`.
   * - 2 nodes
     - Data is available for reads and writes, schema changes are impossible.
     - Restart at least 1 of the 2 nodes that are down to regain quorum. If you can’t recover at least 1 of the 2 nodes, consult the :ref:`manual Raft recovery section <recover-raft-procedure>`.

.. list-table:: Cluster B: 2 datacenters, 6  nodes (3 nodes per DC)
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Failure
     - Consequence
     - Action to take
   * - 1-2 nodes
     - Schema updates are possible and safe.
     - Try restarting the node(s). If the node is dead, :doc:`replace it with a new node </operating-scylla/procedures/cluster-management/replace-dead-node/>`.
   * - 3 nodes
     - Data is available for reads and writes, schema changes are impossible.
     - Restart 1 of the 3 nodes that are down to regain quorum. If you can’t recover at least 1 of the 3 failed nodes, consult the :ref:`manual Raft recovery section <recover-raft-procedure>`.
   * - 1DC
     - Data is available for reads and writes, schema changes are impossible.
     - When the DCs come back online, restart the nodes. If the DC fails to come back online and the nodes are lost, consult the :ref:`manual Raft recovery section <recover-raft-procedure>`.


.. list-table:: Cluster C: 3 datacenter, 9  nodes (3 nodes per DC)
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Failure
     - Consequence
     - Action to take
   * - 1-4 nodes
     - Schema updates are possible and safe.
     - Try restarting the nodes. If the nodes are dead, :doc:`replace them with new nodes </operating-scylla/procedures/cluster-management/replace-dead-node-or-more/>`.
   * - 1 DC
     - Schema updates are possible and safe.
     - When the DC comes back online, try restarting the nodes in the cluster. If the nodes are dead, :doc:`add 3 new nodes in a new region </operating-scylla/procedures/cluster-management/add-dc-to-existing-dc/>`.
   * - 2 DCs
     - Data is available for reads and writes, schema changes are impossible.
     - When the DCs come back online, restart the nodes. If at least one DC fails to come back online and the nodes are lost, consult the :ref:`manual Raft recovery section <recover-raft-procedure>`.

.. _recover-raft-procedure:

Raft manual recovery procedure
==============================

The manual Raft recovery procedure applies to the following situations:

* :ref:`The Raft upgrade procedure <verify-raft-procedure>` got stuck because one of your nodes failed in the middle of the procedure and is irrecoverable,
* or the cluster was running Raft but a majority of nodes (e.g. 2 our of 3) failed and are irrecoverable. Raft cannot progress unless a majority of nodes is available.

.. warning::

   Perform the manual recovery procedure **only** if you're dealing with **irrecoverable** nodes. If it is possible to restart your nodes, do that instead of manual recovery.

.. note::

   Before proceeding, make sure that the irrecoverable nodes are truly dead, and not, for example, temporarily partitioned away due to a network failure. If it is possible for the 'dead' nodes to come back to life, they might communicate and interfere with the recovery procedure and cause unpredictable problems.

   If you have no means of ensuring that these irrecoverable nodes won't come back to life and communicate with the rest of the cluster, setup firewall rules or otherwise isolate your alive nodes to reject any communication attempts from these dead nodes.

During the manual recovery procedure you'll enter a special ``RECOVERY`` mode, remove all faulty nodes (using the standard :doc:`node removal procedure </operating-scylla/procedures/cluster-management/remove-node/>`), delete the internal Raft data, and restart the cluster. This will cause the cluster to perform the Raft upgrade procedure again, initializing the Raft algorithm from scratch. The manual recovery procedure is applicable both to clusters which were not running Raft in the past and then had Raft enabled, and to clusters which were bootstrapped using Raft.

.. note::

   Entering ``RECOVERY`` mode requires a node restart. Restarting an additional node while some nodes are already dead may lead to unavailability of data queries (assuming that you haven't lost it already). For example, if you're using the standard RF=3, CL=QUORUM setup, and you're recovering from a stuck of upgrade procedure because one of your nodes is dead, restarting another node will cause temporary data query unavailability (until the node finishes restarting). Prepare your service for downtime before proceeding.

#. Perform the following query on **every alive node** in the cluster, using e.g. ``cqlsh``:

   .. code-block:: cql

        cqlsh> UPDATE system.scylla_local SET value = 'recovery' WHERE key = 'group0_upgrade_state';

#. Perform a :doc:`rolling restart </operating-scylla/procedures/config-change/rolling-restart/>` of your alive nodes.

#. Verify that all the nodes have entered ``RECOVERY`` mode when restarting; look for one of the following messages in their logs:

    .. code-block:: console

        group0_client - RECOVERY mode.
        raft_group0 - setup_group0: Raft RECOVERY mode, skipping group 0 setup.
        raft_group0_upgrade - RECOVERY mode. Not attempting upgrade.

#. Remove all your dead nodes using the :doc:`node removal procedure </operating-scylla/procedures/cluster-management/remove-node/>`.

#. Remove existing Raft cluster data by performing the following queries on **every alive node** in the cluster, using e.g. ``cqlsh``:

   .. code-block:: cql

        cqlsh> TRUNCATE TABLE system.discovery;
        cqlsh> TRUNCATE TABLE system.group0_history;
        cqlsh> DELETE value FROM system.scylla_local WHERE key = 'raft_group0_id';

#. Make sure that schema is synchronized in the cluster by executing :doc:`nodetool describecluster </operating-scylla/nodetool-commands/describecluster>` on each node and verifying that the schema version is the same on all nodes.

#. We can now leave ``RECOVERY`` mode. On **every alive node**, perform the following query:

   .. code-block:: cql

        cqlsh> DELETE FROM system.scylla_local WHERE key = 'group0_upgrade_state';

#. Perform a :doc:`rolling restart </operating-scylla/procedures/config-change/rolling-restart/>` of your alive nodes.

#. The Raft upgrade procedure will start anew. :ref:`Verify <verify-raft-procedure>` that it finishes successfully.
