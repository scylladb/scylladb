ScyllaDB Alternator: The Open Source DynamoDB-compatible API
               
Project Alternator is an open-source project for an Amazon DynamoDB™-compatible API written in C++. The goal of this project is to deliver an open source alternative to Amazon’s DynamoDB, deployable wherever a user would want: on-premises, on other public clouds like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform, or still on AWS (for users who wish to take advantage of other aspects of Amazon’s market-leading cloud ecosystem, such as the high-density i3en instances). 

DynamoDB users can keep their same client code unchanged.
