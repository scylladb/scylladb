ScyllaDB Drivers
-----------------

The following ScyllaDB drivers are available:

* :doc:`Python Driver</using-scylla/drivers/cql-drivers/scylla-python-driver>`
* :doc:`Java Driver </using-scylla/drivers/cql-drivers/scylla-java-driver>`
* :doc:`Go Driver </using-scylla/drivers/cql-drivers/scylla-go-driver>`
* :doc:`Go Extension </using-scylla/drivers/cql-drivers/scylla-gocqlx-driver>`
* :doc:`C++ Driver </using-scylla/drivers/cql-drivers/scylla-cpp-driver>`
* `CPP-over-Rust Driver <https://github.com/scylladb/cpp-rust-driver>`_
* :doc:`Rust Driver </using-scylla/drivers/cql-drivers/scylla-rust-driver>`

We recommend using ScyllaDB drivers. All ScyllaDB drivers are shard-aware and provide additional 
benefits over third-party drivers.

ScyllaDB supports the CQL binary protocol version 3, so any Apache Cassandra/CQL driver that implements 
the same version works with ScyllaDB.

Driver Support Policy
-------------------------------

We support the **two most recent minor releases** of our drivers.

* We test and validate the latest two minor versions.
* We typically patch only the latest minor release.

We recommend staying up to date with the latest supported versions to receive
updates and fixes.

At a minimum, upgrade your driver when upgrading to a new ScyllaDB version
to ensure compatibility between the driver and the database.

Third-party Drivers

Learn about ScyllaDB Drivers on ScyllaDB University
----------------------------------------------------

  The free `Using ScyllaDB Drivers course <https://university.scylladb.com/courses/using-scylla-drivers/>`_ 
  on ScyllaDB University covers the use of drivers in multiple languages to interact with a ScyllaDB 
  cluster. The languages covered include Java, CPP, Rust, Golang, Python, Node.JS, Scala, and others.
