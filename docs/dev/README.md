# Scylla developer documentation

This folder contains developer-oriented documentation
concerning the ScyllaDB codebase.
We also have a [wiki](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/wiki), which contains
additional developer-oriented documentation. There is currently no clear
definition of what goes where, so when looking for something be sure to check
both.

Seastar documentation can be found [here](http://docs.seastar.io/master/index.html).

User documentation can be found on
[docs.scylladb.com](https://docs.scylladb.com/)

For information on how to build Scylla and how to contribute visit
[HACKING.md](../../HACKING.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
