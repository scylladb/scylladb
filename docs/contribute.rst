We appreciate your help and look forward to welcoming you to the ScyllaDB Community.
There are two ways you can contribute:

Contribute to ScyllaDB's Source Code
------------------------------------
ScyllaDB developers use patches and email to share and discuss changes.
Setting up can take a little time, but once you have done it the first time, itâ€™s easy.

The basic steps are:

* Join the ScyllaDB community
* Create a Git branch to work on
* Commit your work with clear commit messages and sign-offs.
* Send a PR or use ``git format-patch`` and ``git send-email`` to send to the list


The entire process is `documented here <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
