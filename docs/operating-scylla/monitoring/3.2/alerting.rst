Alerting
========

Alerts are a Prometheus enhancement to notify that something is wrong in the system.

You can read more about `Prometheus alerting here`_

..  _`Prometheus alerting  here` : https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/overview/

By default, alerts are shown in the overview dashboard, but you can also configure the alerts to be sent to
other external systems like email or slack.

In general, alerts are generated by Prometheus when a specific condition is met within a certain period of time,
they are then sent to the Alertmanager, which can send them to external systems.

The Alertmanager also acts as a data source for Grafana, so the active alerts are shown in the dashboard.

Prometheus Alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Prometheus alerts are defined in the `prometheus.rules.yml` file that is located in the Prometheus directory.

Each alert consists of:

- Name
- What happened
- For how long
- What to report

For example, let us look at the `InstanceDown` alert that comes by default as part of Scylla-Monitoring.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - alert: InstanceDown
    expr: up == 0
    for: 60s
    labels:
      severity: "2"
    annotations:
      description: '{{ $labels.instance }} has been down for more than 30 seconds.'
      summary: Instance {{ $labels.instance }} down

The **expr** is a legal Prometheus expression. In this case, the **up** metric is equal to **0**.

The **for** set the minimal duration before the alert will be active. Prior to that, the alert will be in pending-mode and will not be sent.

The **labels** part holds additional labels that will be added to the alert, in the example, the **severity** label will be set to **2**.

**annotations** are special labels that add a description to the alert and can be used in emails and notification when the alert is forward to external systems.

Alertmanager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Alertmanager`_ gets the alerts from the Prometheus server and responsible for duplicating, grouping and routing.

..  _`Alertmanager` : https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/

The Alertmanager configuration is found in `rule_config.yml` file that is located in the `prometheus` directory.
The configuration consists of three parts:

- Routes: Represent a routing tree, the most specific rule, wins
- Inhibition: Mute an alert, based on another alert
- Receiver: Send a notification via email, Slack, etc’

Check the Alertmanager documentation the details on how to specify a specific receiver.

In the default configuration, the Grafana server will use the Alertmanager as a data source for the alert table found in the **overview** dashboard. 

Tips When Adding an Alert
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**It's worse having an alert that does not work, then not having an alert at all**

There are multiple ways you can use to make sure your alert is set correctly:

- Start with making sure that the full path (alert to mail or dashboard) is working a simple way is by negating the logic.
- Force the alert to be active by reducing the limits or the duration.
- When possible, simulate the actual scenario and see that the alert works as expected.

For example, low available disk space.

Assume that you want an alert when you have lower than 10% disk space.
You can start by setting the alert that is fire when you have more than 10% disk space.
That would show that the alert is active and is propagated to the dashboard and to any external system you are using.
You can then set the alert rule to a value similar to the current situation.

Now you are sure that when setting the expression to alert when the free space below 10% the alert would work, but if possible, 
simulate that situation, in this case, by creating some big files.

Starting with a simple working expression helps you bisect problems.
