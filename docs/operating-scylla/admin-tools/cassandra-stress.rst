Cassandra Stress
================

The cassandra-stress tool is used for benchmarking and load testing both ScyllaDB and Cassandra clusters. The cassandra-stress tool also supports testing arbitrary CQL tables and queries to allow users to benchmark their data model.

Cassandra Stress is not part of ScyllaDB and it is not distributed along side it anymore. It has it's own seperate repository and release cycle. More information about it can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/scylladb/cassandra-stress>`_ or on `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/scylladb/cassandra-stress>`_.
