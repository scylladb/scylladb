.. warning::

   Review current disk space utilization on existing nodes and make sure the amount of data streamed from the node being removed can fit into the disk space available on the remaining nodes. If there is not enough disk space on the remaining nodes, the removal of a node will fail. Add more storage to remaining nodes **before** starting the removal procedure.
