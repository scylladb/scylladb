.. note::

    This page only applies to clusters where consistent topology updates are not enabled.
    Consistent topology updates are mandatory, so **this page serves troubleshooting purposes**.

    The page does NOT apply if you:

    * Created a cluster with ScyllaDB 6.0 or later (consistent topology updates are automatically enabled).
    * `Manually enabled consistent topology updates <https://opensource.docs.scylladb.com/branch-6.0/upgrade/upgrade-opensource/upgrade-guide-from-5.4-to-6.0/enable-consistent-topology.html>`_
      after upgrading to 6.0 or before upgrading to 6.1 (required).
