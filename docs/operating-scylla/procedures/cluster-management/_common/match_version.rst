.. Note:: 

   Make sure to use the same ScyllaDB **patch release** on the new/replaced node, to match the rest of the cluster. It is not recommended to add a new node with a different release to the cluster.
   For example, use the following for installing ScyllaDB patch release (use your deployed version):

   .. code::

      sudo yum install scylla-2025.1.0
