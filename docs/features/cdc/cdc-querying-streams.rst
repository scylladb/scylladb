====================
Querying CDC Streams
====================

Some use cases for CDC may require querying the log table periodically in short intervals. One way to do that would be to perform **partition scans**, where you don't specify the partition (in this case, the stream) which you want to query, for example:

.. code-block:: cql

 SELECT * FROM ks.t_scylla_cdc_log;

Although partition scans are convenient, they require the read coordinator to contact the entire cluster, not just a small set of replicas defined by the replication factor.

The recommended alternative is to query each stream separately:

.. code-block:: cql

 SELECT * FROM ks.t_scylla_cdc_log WHERE "cdc$stream_id" = 0x365fd1a9ae34373954529ac8169dfb93;

With the above approach you can, for instance, build a distributed CDC consumer, where each of the consumer nodes queries only streams that are replicated to ScyllaDB nodes in proximity to the consumer node. This allows efficient, concurrent querying of streams, without putting strain on a single node due to a partition scan.

Reacting to stream changes
--------------------------

As explained in :doc:`CDC Stream Changes </features/cdc/cdc-stream-changes/>`, the set of used CDC stream IDs may change due to some events. You should then query the CDC description table to read the new set of stream IDs and the corresponding timestamp.

If you're periodically querying streams and you don't want to miss any writes that are sent to the old generation, you should query it at least one time **after** the old generation stops operating (which happens when the new generation starts operating).

Keep in mind that time is relative: every node has its own clock. Therefore you should make sure that the old generation stops operating **from the point of view of every node** in the cluster **before** you query it one last time and start querying the new generation.

Example: switching streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose that ``cdc_generation_timestamps`` contains the following entries:

.. code-block:: none

  time
 ---------------------------------
  2020-03-25 16:05:29.484000+0000
  2020-03-25 12:44:43.006000+0000

 (2 rows)

The currently operating generation's timestamp is ``2020-03-25 16:05:29.484000+0000`` --- the highest one in the above list. You've been periodically querying all streams in this generation. In the meantime, a new node is bootstrapped, hence a new generation appears:


.. code-block:: none

     time
    ---------------------------------
     2020-03-25 17:21:45.360000+0000
     2020-03-25 16:05:29.484000+0000
     2020-03-25 12:44:43.006000+0000

    (3 rows)

You should keep querying streams from generation ``2020-03-25 16:05:29.484000+0000`` until after you make sure that every node's clock moved past ``2020-03-25 17:21:45.360000+0000``. One way to do that is to connect to each node and use the ``now()`` function:

.. code-block:: none

    $ cqlsh 127.0.0.1
    Connected to  at 127.0.0.1:9042.
    [cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.0.8 | CQL spec 3.3.1 | Native protocol v4]
    Use HELP for help.
    cqlsh> select totimestamp(now()) from system.local;

     system.totimestamp(system.now())
    ----------------------------------
      2020-03-25 17:24:34.104000+0000

    (1 rows)
    cqlsh>
    $ cqlsh 127.0.0.4
    Connected to  at 127.0.0.4:9042.
    [cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.0.8 | CQL spec 3.3.1 | Native protocol v4]
    Use HELP for help.
    cqlsh> select totimestamp(now()) from system.local;

     system.totimestamp(system.now())
    ----------------------------------
      2020-03-25 17:24:42.038000+0000

    (1 rows)

and so on. After you make sure that every node uses the new generation, you can query streams from the previous generation one last time, and then switch to querying streams from the new generation.

Querying CDC Streams
--------------------

The system tables used for CDC stream descriptions differ depending on whether your keyspace uses vnodes or tablets. The following sections describe how to query CDC streams for each keyspace type:

- :ref:`Vnode-based keyspaces <vnode-based-keyspaces>`
- :ref:`Tablets-based keyspaces <tablets-based-keyspaces>`

.. note::
   We highly recommend using the newest releases of our client CDC libraries (`Java CDC library <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-cdc-java>`_, `Go CDC library <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-cdc-go>`_, `Rust CDC library <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-cdc-rust>`_). They take care of correctly querying the stream description tables and they handle the upgrade procedure for you.

.. _vnode-based-keyspaces:

Vnode-based keyspaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query the log table without performing partition scans, you need to know which streams to look at. For this you can use the ``system_distributed.cdc_generation_timestamps`` and ``system_distributed.cdc_streams_descriptions_v2`` tables.

Example: querying the CDC description table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Retrieve the timestamp of the currently operating CDC generation from the ``cdc_generation_timestamps`` table. If you have a multi-node cluster, query the table with QUORUM or ALL consistency level so you don't miss any entry:

   .. code-block:: cql

    CONSISTENCY QUORUM;
    SELECT time FROM system_distributed.cdc_generation_timestamps WHERE key = 'timestamps';

   The query can return multiple entries:

   .. code-block:: none

     time
    ---------------------------------
     2020-03-25 16:05:29.484000+0000
     2020-03-25 12:44:43.006000+0000

    (2 rows)

   Take the highest one. In our case this is ``2020-03-25 16:05:29.484000+0000``.

#. Retrieve the list of stream IDs in the current CDC generation from the ``cdc_streams_descriptions_v2`` table. Unfortunately, to use the time-date value in a ``WHERE`` clause, you have to modify the format of the time-date a little by removing the last three 0s before the ``+``. In our case, the modified time-date is ``2020-03-25 16:05:29.484+0000``:

   .. code-block:: cql

    CONSISTENCY QUORUM;
    SELECT streams FROM system_distributed.cdc_streams_descriptions_v2 WHERE time = '2020-03-25 16:05:29.484+0000';

   The result consists of a number of rows (most likely returned in multiple pages, unless you turned off paging), each row containing a list of stream IDs, such as:

   .. code-block:: none

     streams
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     {0x7ffe0c687fcce86e0783343730000001, 0x80000000000000010d9ee5f1f4000001, 0x800555555555555653e250f2d8000001}
     {0x807ae73e07dbd4122e32d36e08000011, 0x80800000000000001facbbb618000011, 0x80838c6b76e19a1bc3581db310000011}
     {0x80838c6b76e19a1c6da83d4d14000021, 0x80855555555555566d556a0a18000021, 0x808aaaaaaaaaaaabf1008f4120000021}
     {0x80c5343222b6eee636e3ed42d0000031, 0x80c5555555555556efd251b0b8000031, 0x80caaaaaaaaaaaabb9bde28998000031}
     ...

    (256 rows)

   Save all stream IDs returned by the query. When we ran the example, the query returned 256 * 3 = 768 stream IDs.

#. Use the obtained stream IDs to query your CDC log tables:

   .. code-block:: cql

    CREATE TABLE ks.t (pk int, ck int, v int, primary key (pk, ck)) WITH cdc = {'enabled': true};
    INSERT INTO ks.t (pk, ck, v) values (0, 0, 0);
    SELECT * FROM ks.t_scylla_cdc_log WHERE "cdc$stream_id" = 0x7ffe0c687fcce86e0783343730000001;
    SELECT * FROM ks.t_scylla_cdc_log WHERE "cdc$stream_id" = 0x80000000000000010d9ee5f1f4000001;
    ...

   Each change will be present in exactly one of these stream IDs. When we ran the example, it was:

   .. code-block:: cql

    SELECT * FROM ks.t_scylla_cdc_log WHERE "cdc$stream_id" = 0xced00000000000009663c8dc500005a1;

   .. code-block:: none

     cdc$stream_id                      | cdc$time                             | cdc$batch_seq_no | cdc$deleted_v | cdc$end_of_batch | cdc$operation | cdc$ttl | ck | pk | v
    ------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+------------------+---------------+------------------+---------------+---------+----+----+---
     0xced00000000000009663c8dc500005a1 | 7a370e64-819f-11eb-c419-1f717873d8fa |                0 |          null |             True |             2 |    null |  0 |  0 | 0

    (1 rows)


Query all streams to read the entire CDC log.

.. _tablets-based-keyspaces:

Tablets-based keyspaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scylla exposes two system tables to provide information about CDC streams for CDC consumers:

- ``system.cdc_timestamps``: This table records the timestamps when CDC streams are changed.
  CDC consumers use this table to learn when any changes to streams have occurred.
  After discovering a relevant timestamp in ``system.cdc_timestamps``, the consumer can then query the ``system.cdc_streams`` table for that specific timestamp to get detailed information about the streams at that point in time.

- ``system.cdc_streams``: For each timestamp, this table shows the set of streams operating at that timestamp, as well as the changes from the previous timestamp (such as streams being opened or closed).
  Each row includes the streamâ€™s state (``stream_state``), which describes whether the stream is active, opened, or closed at this timestamp.

The ``stream_state`` column in ``system.cdc_streams`` formally describes the lifecycle of a stream at a given timestamp:

- **0 (active):** The stream is active and can be queried for CDC data at this timestamp.
- **1 (closed):** The stream was closed at this timestamp; no new CDC data will be written to this stream after this point.
- **2 (opened):** The stream was opened at this timestamp; CDC data for this stream starts from this point.

To list all available CDC streams for a tablets-based keyspace:

1. Retrieve the timestamps of the CDC stream sets for your table:

   .. code-block:: cql

      SELECT timestamp FROM system.cdc_timestamps WHERE keyspace_name = 'ks' AND table_name = 't';

   The query returns all timestamps in descending order. The first timestamp is the timestamp for the currently operating CDC stream set. For example:

   .. code-block:: none

      timestamp
      ---------------------------------
      2025-09-02 15:34:42.467000+0000
      2025-09-02 15:33:27.888000+0000

      (2 rows)

2. Retrieve all CDC streams for a specific timestamp (stream_state = 0 means the stream is active at this timestamp):

   .. code-block:: cql

      SELECT stream_id FROM system.cdc_streams WHERE keyspace_name = 'ks' AND table_name = 't' AND timestamp = '2025-09-02 15:34:42.467+0000' AND stream_state = 0;

   For example, the query can return:

   .. code-block:: none

      stream_id
      ------------------------------------
      0xbfffffffffffffffa15608ebf0000001
      0xffffffffffffffff372c68c25c000001
      0x3fffffffffffffff73b3f26904000001
      0x7fffffffffffffff1ef74fe610000001

      (4 rows)

   Or, you can query for the streams that were opened or closed at a specific timestamp as follows:

   .. code-block:: cql

      SELECT stream_id FROM system.cdc_streams WHERE keyspace_name = 'ks' AND table_name = 't' AND timestamp = '2025-09-02 15:34:42.467+0000' AND stream_state >= 1 AND stream_state <= 2;

   returns:

   .. code-block:: none

      stream_state | stream_id
      -------------+------------------------------------
                 1 | 0xffffffffffffffffdb6cb86b34000001
                 1 | 0x7fffffffffffffff0ded3e1868000001
                 2 | 0xbfffffffffffffffa15608ebf0000001
                 2 | 0xffffffffffffffff372c68c25c000001
                 2 | 0x3fffffffffffffff73b3f26904000001
                 2 | 0x7fffffffffffffff1ef74fe610000001

      (4 rows)

3. Use the obtained stream IDs to query your CDC log tables:

   .. code-block:: cql

      SELECT * FROM ks.t_scylla_cdc_log WHERE "cdc$stream_id" = 0xffffffffffffffffdb6cb86b34000001;
      SELECT * FROM ks.t_scylla_cdc_log WHERE "cdc$stream_id" = 0x7fffffffffffffff0ded3e1868000001;
      ...

   Query all streams to read the entire CDC log.

Garbage collection of CDC streams metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For tablets-based keyspaces, Scylla periodically performs garbage collection of old CDC streams metadata in the ``system.cdc_timestamps`` and ``system.cdc_streams`` tables.
This process removes information about streams that are no longer needed, helping to prevent unbounded growth of the metadata tables.

The garbage collection process runs periodically in the background and examines streams that have been closed.
It removes information about a stream if the stream's close timestamp is older than the configured TTL of the CDC table.
Since the stream has been closed for longer than the TTL, this means that all rows in this stream have also exceeded their TTL and expired, unless the table's TTL was altered to a smaller value after some rows have been written.

.. warning::
   When altering the TTL of a CDC table to a smaller value, you can lose information about streams that still contain live rows. Make sure to read all the information you need from the ``system.cdc_timestamps`` and ``system.cdc_streams`` tables before performing such alterations.
