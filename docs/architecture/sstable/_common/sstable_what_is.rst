:term:`Sorted Strings Table (SSTable)<SSTable>` is the persistent file format used by ScyllaDB and Apache Cassandra. SSTable is saved as a persistent, ordered, immutable set of files on disk.
Immutable means SSTables are never modified; they are created by a MemTable flush and are deleted by a compaction.
The location of ScyllaDB SSTables is specified in scylla.yaml ``data_file_directories`` parameter (default location: ``/var/lib/scylla/data``).

SSTable 3.x is more efficient and requires less disk space than the SSTable 2.x.
