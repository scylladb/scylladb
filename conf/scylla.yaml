# Scylla storage config YAML

#######################################
# This file is split to two sections:
# 1. Supported parameters
# 2. Unsupported parameters: reserved for future use or backwards
#    compatibility.
# Scylla will only read and use the first segment
#######################################

### Supported Parameters

# The name of the cluster. This is mainly used to prevent machines in
# one logical cluster from joining another.
# It is recommended to change the default value when creating a new cluster.
# You can NOT modify this value for an existing cluster
#cluster_name: 'Test Cluster'

# This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring
# The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data
# that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same number
# of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.
#
# If you already have a cluster with 1 token per node, and wish to migrate to 
# multiple tokens per node, see http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/operating
num_tokens: 256

# Directory where Scylla should store all its files, which are commitlog,
# data, hints, view_hints and saved_caches subdirectories. All of these
# subs can be overriden by the respective options below.
# If unset, the value defaults to /var/lib/scylla
# workdir: /var/lib/scylla

# Directory where Scylla should store data on disk.
# data_file_directories:
#    - /var/lib/scylla/data

# commit log.  when running on magnetic HDD, this should be a
# separate spindle than the data directories.
# commitlog_directory: /var/lib/scylla/commitlog

# commitlog_sync may be either "periodic" or "batch."
#
# When in batch mode, Scylla won't ack writes until the commit log
# has been fsynced to disk.  It will wait
# commitlog_sync_batch_window_in_ms milliseconds between fsyncs.
# This window should be kept short because the writer threads will
# be unable to do extra work while waiting.  (You may need to increase
# concurrent_writes for the same reason.)
#
# commitlog_sync: batch
# commitlog_sync_batch_window_in_ms: 2
#
# the other option is "periodic" where writes may be acked immediately
# and the CommitLog is simply synced every commitlog_sync_period_in_ms
# milliseconds.
commitlog_sync: periodic
commitlog_sync_period_in_ms: 10000

# The size of the individual commitlog file segments.  A commitlog
# segment may be archived, deleted, or recycled once all the data
# in it (potentially from each columnfamily in the system) has been
# flushed to sstables.
#
# The default size is 32, which is almost always fine, but if you are
# archiving commitlog segments (see commitlog_archiving.properties),
# then you probably want a finer granularity of archiving; 8 or 16 MB
# is reasonable.
commitlog_segment_size_in_mb: 32

# seed_provider class_name is saved for future use.
# seeds address(es) are mandatory!
seed_provider:
    # Addresses of hosts that are deemed contact points. 
    # Scylla nodes use this list of hosts to find each other and learn
    # the topology of the ring.  You must change this if you are running
    # multiple nodes!
    - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
      parameters:
          # seeds is actually a comma-delimited list of addresses.
          # Ex: "<ip1>,<ip2>,<ip3>"
          - seeds: "127.0.0.1"

# Address or interface to bind to and tell other Scylla nodes to connect to.
# You _must_ change this if you want multiple nodes to be able to communicate!
#
# Setting listen_address to 0.0.0.0 is always wrong.
listen_address: localhost

# Address to broadcast to other Scylla nodes
# Leaving this blank will set it to the same value as listen_address
# broadcast_address: 1.2.3.4


# When using multiple physical network interfaces, set this to true to listen on broadcast_address
# in addition to the listen_address, allowing nodes to communicate in both interfaces.
# Ignore this property if the network configuration automatically routes between the public and private networks such as EC2.
#
# listen_on_broadcast_address: false

# port for the CQL native transport to listen for clients on
# For security reasons, you should not expose this port to the internet.  Firewall it if needed.

native_transport_port: 9042

# Like native_transport_port, but clients are forwarded to specific shards, based on the
# client-side port numbers.
native_shard_aware_transport_port: 19042

# Enabling native transport encryption in client_encryption_options allows you to either use
# encryption for the standard port or to use a dedicated, additional port along with the unencrypted
# standard native_transport_port.
# Enabling client encryption and keeping native_transport_port_ssl disabled will use encryption
# for native_transport_port. Setting native_transport_port_ssl to a different value
# from native_transport_port will use encryption for native_transport_port_ssl while
# keeping native_transport_port unencrypted.
#native_transport_port_ssl: 9142

# Like native_transport_port_ssl, but clients are forwarded to specific shards, based on the

# IEndpointSnitch.  The snitch has two functions:
# - it teaches Scylla enough about your network topology to route
#   requests efficiently
# - it allows Scylla to spread replicas around your cluster to avoid
#   correlated failures. It does this by grouping machines into
#   "datacenters" and "racks."  Scylla will do its best not to have
#   more than one replica on the same "rack" (which may not actually
#   be a physical location)
#
# IF YOU CHANGE THE SNITCH AFTER DATA IS INSERTED INTO THE CLUSTER,
# YOU MUST RUN A FULL REPAIR, SINCE THE SNITCH AFFECTS WHERE REPLICAS
# ARE PLACED.
#
# Out of the box, Scylla provides
#  - SimpleSnitch:
#    Treats Strategy order as proximity. This can improve cache
#    locality when disabling read repair.  Only appropriate for
#    single-datacenter deployments.
#  - GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
#    This should be your go-to snitch for production use.  The rack
#    and datacenter for the local node are defined in
#    cassandra-rackdc.properties and propagated to other nodes via
#    gossip.  If cassandra-topology.properties exists, it is used as a
#    fallback, allowing migration from the PropertyFileSnitch.
#  - PropertyFileSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    explicitly configured in cassandra-topology.properties.
#  - Ec2Snitch:
#    Appropriate for EC2 deployments in a single Region. Loads Region
#    and Availability Zone information from the EC2 API. The Region is
#    treated as the datacenter, and the Availability Zone as the rack.
#    Only private IPs are used, so this will not work across multiple
#    Regions.
#  - Ec2MultiRegionSnitch:
#    Uses public IPs as broadcast_address to allow cross-region
#    connectivity.  (Thus, you should set seed addresses to the public
#    IP as well.) You will need to open the storage_port or
#    ssl_storage_port on the public IP firewall.  (For intra-Region
#    traffic, Scylla will switch to the private IP after
#    establishing a connection.)
#  - RackInferringSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    assumed to correspond to the 3rd and 2nd octet of each node's IP
#    address, respectively.  Unless this happens to match your
#    deployment conventions, this is best used as an example of
#    writing a custom Snitch class and is provided in that spirit.
#
# You can use a custom Snitch by setting this to the full class name
# of the snitch, which will be assumed to be on your classpath.

# The address or interface to bind the Thrift RPC service and native transport
# server to.
#
# Set rpc_address OR rpc_interface, not both. Interfaces must correspond
# to a single address, IP aliasing is not supported.
#
# Leaving rpc_address blank has the same effect as on listen_address
# (i.e. it will be based on the configured hostname of the node).
#
# Note that unlike listen_address, you can specify 0.0.0.0, but you must also
# set broadcast_rpc_address to a value other than 0.0.0.0.
#
# For security reasons, you should not expose this port to the internet.  Firewall it if needed.
#
# If you choose to specify the interface by name and the interface has an ipv4 and an ipv6 address
# you can specify which should be chosen using rpc_interface_prefer_ipv6. If false the first ipv4
# address will be used. If true the first ipv6 address will be used. Defaults to false preferring

# Authentication backend, identifying users
# Out of the box, Scylla provides org.apache.cassandra.auth.{AllowAllAuthenticator,

#
# - AllowAllAuthenticator performs no checks - set it to disable authentication.
# - PasswordAuthenticator relies on username/password pairs to authenticate

#   Please increase system_auth keyspace replication factor if you use this authenticator.
# authenticator: AllowAllAuthenticator

# Authorization backend, implementing IAuthorizer; used to limit access/provide permissions
# Out of the box, Scylla provides org.apache.cassandra.auth.{AllowAllAuthorizer,

#
# - AllowAllAuthorizer allows any action to any user - set it to disable authorization.
# - CassandraAuthorizer stores permissions in system_auth.permissions table. Please
#   increase system_auth keyspace replication factor if you use this authorizer.

# Total space to use for commitlogs.
