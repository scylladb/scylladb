// The voter calculator is responsible for distributing voters in group 0.
//
// It calculates the optimal distribution of voters across datacenters and racks, ensuring:
// 1. The number of voters in each datacenter is balanced.
// 2. No single datacenter or rack holds at least half of the total voters (when the number of DCs/racks >= 3).
//
// For scenarios with 2 datacenters (or 2 racks in a single datacenter), the calculator ensures an asymmetric
// distribution of voters. This allows the system to tolerate the loss of the datacenter or rack with fewer voters.
//
// Additionally, the calculator maximizes the "distance" between voters in group 0. The "distance" is based on
// node properties, such as datacenter or rack location. For example, nodes in different datacenters are considered
// farther apart than nodes in the same datacenter. This approach ensures an even distribution of voters across
// datacenters and racks.
