/**
 * Since most group0 commands are just mutations it is easy to combine them
 * before passing them to a subsystem they are destined to since it is more
 * efficient. The logic that handles those mutations in a subsystem will
 * run once for each batch of commands instead of for each individual
 * command. This is especially useful when a node catches up to a leader and
 * gets a lot of commands together.
 *
 * The `group0_state_machine_merger` does exactly that. It combines commands
 * into a single command if possible, but it preserves an order between commands,
 * so each time it encounters a command to a different subsystem it flushes already
 * combined batch and starts a new one. This extra safety assumes that
 * there are dependencies between subsystems managed by group0, so the order
 * matters. It may be not the case now, but we prefer to be on a safe side.
 *
 * Broadcast table commands are not mutations, so they are never combined.
