# This file contains regx patterns that should be
# excluded from coverage reports. The file exists for easy
# synchronization between different runs of coverage or different
# frameworks running tests for unified coverage report.
# The format is simple:
# 1. lines that start with # are comments and should be ignored
# 2. empty lines should be ignored
# 3. every other line contains a single regx pattern of files to exclude
# Note if the string should start with '#' simply put (#) instead.
