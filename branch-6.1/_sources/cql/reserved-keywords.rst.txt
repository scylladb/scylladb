Reserved CQL Keywords
=====================

CQL distinguishes between reserved and non-reserved keywords. 

Reserved keywords cannot be used as identifiers. They are truly reserved for the language (but one can enclose a reserved keyword by single or double-quotes to use it as an identifier). The following keywords are reserved:


* ADD	
* ALLOW	
* ALTER	
* AND

* ASC	
* AUTHORIZE	
* BATCH	
* BEGIN

* GRANT	
* IF	
* IN	
* INDEX	
* INFINITY	
* INSERT	
* INTO	
* KEYSPACE	
* LIMIT	
* MODIFY
