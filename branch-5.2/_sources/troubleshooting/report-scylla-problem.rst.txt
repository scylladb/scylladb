How to Report a ScyllaDB Problem
==================================


In the event there is an issue you would like to report to ScyllaDB support, you need to submit logs and other files which help the support team diagnose the issue. Only the ScyllaDB support team members can read the data you share. 

In general, there are two types of issues:

* **Scylla failure** - There is some kind of failure, possibly due to a connectivity issue, a timeout, or otherwise, where the Scylla server or the Scylla nodes are not working. These cases require you to send ScyllaDB support both a `Health Check Report`_ as well as `Core Dump`_ files (if available).
* **Scylla performance** - you have noticed some type of degradation of service with Scylla reads or writes. If it is clearly a performance case and not a failure, refer to `Report a performance problem`_.

Once you have used our diagnostic tools to report the current status, you need to `Send files to ScyllaDB support`_ for further analysis.

Make sure the Scylla system logs are configured properly to report info level messages: `install debug info <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/wiki/How-to-install-scylla-debug-info/>`_.

.. note:: 
   If you are unsure which reports need to be included, `Open a support ticket or GitHub issue`_ and consult with the ScyllaDB team. 

Health Check Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Health Check Report is a script which generates:

* An archive file (output_files.tgz) containing configuration data (hardware, OS, Scylla SW, etc.) 
* System logs 
* A Report file ``(<node_IP>-health-check-report.txt)`` based on the collected info.

If your node configuration is identical across the cluster, you only need to run the script once on one node. If not you will need to run the script on multiple nodes.

.. note:: In order to generate a full health check report, scylla-server and scylla-jmx must be running. Note that the script will alert you if either one is not running. By default, the script looks for scylla-jmx via port 7199. If you are running it on a different port, you will have to provide the port number at runtime. 

Prepare Health Check Report
...........................

**Procedure:**

1. Run the node healthcheck:

.. code-block:: shell

   node_health_check
 
The report generates output files. Once complete, a similar message is displayed:

.. code-block:: shell

   Health Check Report Created Successfully
   Path to Report: ./192.0.2.0-health-check-report.txt

If an error message displays check that scylla-server and scylla-jmx must be running. See the note in `Health Check Report`_.

2. Follow the instructions in `Send files to ScyllaDB support`_.

.. _report-scylla-problem-core-dump:

Core Dump
^^^^^^^^^

When Scylla fails, it creates a core dump which can later be used to debug the issue. The file is written to ``/var/lib/scylla/coredump``. If there is no file in the directory, see `Troubleshooting Core Dump`_.


Compress the core dump file
...........................

**Procedure**

1. The core dump file can be very large. Make sure to zip it using ``xz`` or similar. 

.. code-block:: shell

   xz -z core.21692

2. Upload the compressed file to upload.scylladb.com. See `Send files to ScyllaDB support`_.


Troubleshooting Core Dump
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the event the ``/var/lib/scylla/coredump`` directory is empty, the following solutions may help. Note that this section only handles some of the reasons why a core dump file is not created. It should be noted that in some cases where a core dump file fails to create not because it is in the wrong location or because the system is not configured to generate core dump files, but because the failure itself created an issue where the core dump file wasn't created or is not accessible. 

Operating System not set to generate core dump files
....................................................

If Scylla restarts for some reason and there is no core dump file, the OS system deamon needs to be modified.

**Procedure**

1. Open the custom configuration file. ``/etc/systemd/coredump.conf.d/custom.conf``.

2. Refer to :ref:`generate core dumps <admin-core-dumps>` for details. 


.. note:: You will need spare disk space larger than that of Scylla's RAM.


Core dump file exists, but not where you expect it to be
........................................................

If the ``scylla/coredump`` directory is empty even after you changed the custom configuration file, it might be that Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT) is running and all core dumps are pipelined directly to it.

**Procedure**

1. Check the ``/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`` file.
   If it contains something similar to ``|/usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp %s %c %p %u %g %t %h %e 636f726500`` replace the contents with ``core``.

.. _report-performance-problem:

Report a performance problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
If you are experiencing a performance issue when using Scylla, let us know and we can help. To save time and increase the likelihood of a speedy solution, it is important to supply us with as much information as possible.

Include the following information in your report:

* A complete `Health Check Report`_ 
* A `Server Metrics`_ Report 
* A `Client Metrics`_ Report
* The contents of your tracing data. See :ref:`Collecting Tracing Data <tracing-collecting-tracing-data>`.

Metrics Reports
...............

There are two types of metrics you need to collect: Scylla Server and Scylla Client (node). The Scylla Server metrics can be displayed using an external monitoring service like `Scylla Monitoring Stack <https://monitoring.docs.scylladb.com/>`_ or they can be collected using `scyllatop <http://www.scylladb.com/2016/03/22/scyllatop/>`_ and other commands.

.. note:: 
   It is highly recommended to use the Scylla monitoring stack so that the Prometheus metrics collected can be shared. 

Server Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several commands you can use to see if there is a performance issue on the Scylla Server. Note that checking the CPU load using ``top`` is not a good metric for checking Scylla. 
Use ``scyllatop`` instead. 

.. note:: 
   To help the ScyllaDB support team assess your problem, it is best to pipe the results to a file which you can attach with the Health Check report.

1. Check the ``Send files to ScyllaDB supportgauge-load``. If the load is close to 100%, the bottleneck is Scylla CPU. 

.. code-block:: shell

   scyllatop *gauge-load

2. Check if one of Scylla core is busier than the others:

.. code-block:: shell

   sar -P ALL

3. Check the load on one CPU (0 in this example)

.. code-block:: shell

   perf top -C0 

4. Check if the disk utilization percentage is close to 100%. If yes, the disk might be the bottleneck.

.. code-block:: shell
   
   ostat -x 1`` to observe the disk utilization. 

5. Collect run time statistics.

.. code-block:: shell
   
   sudo perf record --call-graph dwarf -C 0 -F 99 -p $(ps -C scylla -o pid --no-headers) -g sleep 10  
   

Alternatively, you can run the ``sudo ./collect-runtime-info.sh`` ` which does all of the above, except scyllatop and uploads the compressed result to s3.

The script contents is  as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   #!/bin/bash -e

   mkdir report
   rpm -qa > ./report/rpm.txt
   journalctl -b > ./report/journalctl.txt
   df -k > ./report/df.txt
   netstat > ./report/netstat.txt

   sar -P ALL > ./report/sar.txt
   iostat -d 1 10 > ./report/iostat.txt
   sudo perf record --call-graph dwarf -C 0 -F 99 -p $(ps -C scylla -o pid --no-headers) -g --output ./report/perf.data sleep 10

   export report_uuid=$(uuidgen)
   echo $report_uuid
   tar c report | xz > report.tar.xz
   curl --request PUT --upload-file report.tar.xz "scylladb-users-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/$report_uuid/report.tar.xz"
   echo $report_uuid

You can also see the results in `./report` dir

Server Metrics with Prometheus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using `Grafana and Prometheus to monitor Scylla <https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-monitoring>`_, sharing the metrics stored in Prometheus is very useful. This procedure shows how to gather the metrics from the monitoring server.

**Procedure**

1. Validate Prometheus instance is running 

.. code-block:: shell

   docker ps

2. Download the DB, using your CONTAINER ID instead of a64bf3ba0b7f 

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo docker cp a64bf3ba0b7f:/prometheus /tmp/prometheus_data

3. Zip the file.

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo tar -zcvf /tmp/prometheus_data.tar.gz /tmp/prometheus_data/

4. Upload the file you created in step 3 to upload.scylladb.com (see `Send files to ScyllaDB support`_).


Client Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Check the client CPU using ``top``. If the CPU is close to 100%, the bottleneck is the client CPU. In this case, you should add more loaders to stress Scylla.


Send files to ScyllaDB support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have collected and compressed your reports, send them to ScyllaDB for analysis. 

**Procedure**

.. _uuid:

1. Generate a UUID:

.. code-block:: shell

   export report_uuid=$(uuidgen) 
   echo $report_uuid

2. Upload **all required** report files:

.. code-block:: shell

   curl -X PUT https://upload.scylladb.com/$report_uuid/yourfile -T yourfile


For example with the health check report and node health check report:


.. code-block:: shell

   curl -X PUT https://upload.scylladb.com/$report_uuid/output_files.tgz -T output_files.tgz

  
.. code-block:: shell
 
   curl -X PUT https://upload.scylladb.com/$report_uuid/192.0.2.0-health-check-report.txt -T 192.0.2.0-health-check-report.txt


The **UUID** you generated replaces the variable ``$report_uuid`` at runtime. ``yourfile`` is any file you need to send to ScyllaDB support.


Open a support ticket or GitHub issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have not done so already, supply ScyllaDB support with the UUID. Keep in mind that although the ID you supply is public, only ScyllaDB support team members can read the data you share. In the ticket/issue you open, list the documents you have uploaded.

**Procedure**

1. Do *one* of the following:

* If you are a Scylla customer, open a `Support Ticket`_ and **include the UUID** within the ticket.

.. _Support Ticket: http://scylladb.com/support


* If you are a Scylla user, open an issue on `GitHub`_ and **include the UUID** within the issue.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/issues/new
