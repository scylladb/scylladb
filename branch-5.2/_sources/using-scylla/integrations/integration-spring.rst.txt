==============================
Integrate Scylla with Spring
==============================

`Spring <https://spring.io>`_ is a java framework for creating easy to use web services.
`Spring Boot <https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot>`_ makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
If you have tested your application with Scylla and Spring and want to publish the results, contact us using the `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/scylladb-users>`_.
