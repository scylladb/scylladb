Upgrade Guide - |SCYLLA_NAME| |SRC_VERSION| to |NEW_VERSION|
=============================================================================

This document is a step by step procedure for upgrading from |SCYLLA_NAME| |SRC_VERSION| to |SCYLLA_NAME| Enterpise |NEW_VERSION|, and rollback to version |SRC_VERSION| if required.

This guide covers upgrading ScyllaDB on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu. See :doc:`OS Support by Platform and Version </getting-started/os-support>` for information about supported versions.

This guide also applies when you're upgrading ScyllaDB Enterprise official image on EC2, GCP, or Azure. The image is based on Ubuntu 20.04.

Upgrade Procedure
=================

A ScyllaDB upgrade is a rolling procedure which does **not** require full cluster shutdown.
For each of the nodes in the cluster you will:

* Check that the cluster's schema is synchronized
* Drain the node and backup the data
* Backup the configuration file
* Stop ScyllaDB
* Download and install new ScyllaDB packages
* Start ScyllaDB
* Validate that the upgrade was successful


.. caution:: 

   Apply the procedure **serially** on each node. Do not move to the next node before validating that the node you upgraded is up and running the new version.

**During** the rolling upgrade, it is highly recommended:

* Not to use the new |NEW_VERSION| features.
* Not to run administration functions, like repairs, refresh, rebuild or add or remove nodes. See `sctool <https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/stable/sctool/>`_ for suspending ScyllaDB Manager's scheduled or running repairs.
* Not to apply schema changes.

.. note:: Before upgrading, make sure to use the latest `ScyllaDB Monitoring <https://monitoring.docs.scylladb.com/>`_ stack.

Upgrade Steps
=============

Check the cluster schema
-------------------------
Make sure that all nodes have the schema synchronized before upgrade. The upgrade procedure will fail if there is a schema disagreement between nodes.

.. code:: sh

   nodetool describecluster

Drain the nodes and backup the data
-----------------------------------

Before any major procedure, like an upgrade, it is recommended to backup all the data to an external device. In ScyllaDB, you can backup 
the data using the ``nodetool snapshot`` command. For **each** node in the cluster, run the following command:

.. code:: sh

   nodetool drain
   nodetool snapshot

Take note of the directory name that nodetool gives you, and copy all the directories having that name under ``/var/lib/scylla`` to 
a backup device.

When the upgrade is completed on all nodes, remove the snapshot with the ``nodetool clearsnapshot -t <snapshot>`` command to 
prevent running out of space.

Backup the configuration file
------------------------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo cp -a /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml.backup-src

Gracefully stop the node
------------------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo service scylla-server stop

.. _upgrade-debian-ubuntu-5.1-to-enterprise-2022.2: 

Download and install the new release
------------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

        Before upgrading, check what version you are running now using ``dpkg -s scylla-server``. You should use the same version as this version in case you want to |ROLLBACK|_ the upgrade. If you are not running a |SRC_VERSION|.x version, stop right here! This guide only covers |SRC_VERSION|.x to |NEW_VERSION|.y upgrades.

        **To upgrade ScyllaDB:**

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_DEB_NEW_REPO| to |NEW_VERSION| and and enable scylla/ppa repo:

            .. code-block:: console

               sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:scylladb/ppa

        #. Configure Java 1.8:

            .. code-block:: console

               sudo apt-get update
               sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jre-headless
               sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64

        #. Install the new ScyllaDB version:

            .. code-block:: console

               sudo apt-get clean all
               sudo apt-get update
               sudo apt-get remove scylla\*
               sudo apt-get install scylla-enterprise
               sudo systemctl daemon-reload

        Answer ‘y’ to the first two questions.

   .. group-tab:: RHEL/CentOS

        Before upgrading, check what version you are running now using ``rpm -qa | grep scylla-server``. You should use the same version as this version in case you want to |ROLLBACK|_ the upgrade. If you are not running a |SRC_VERSION|.x version, stop right here! This guide only covers |SRC_VERSION|.x to |NEW_VERSION|.y upgrades.

        **To upgrade ScyllaDB:**

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_RPM_NEW_REPO|_  to |NEW_VERSION|.
        #. Install the new ScyllaDB version:

            .. code:: sh

               sudo yum clean all
               sudo rm -rf /var/cache/yum
               sudo yum remove scylla\*
               sudo yum install scylla-enterprise

   .. group-tab:: EC2/GCP/Azure Ubuntu Image

        Before upgrading, check what version you are running now using ``dpkg -s scylla-server``. You should use the same version as this version in case you want to |ROLLBACK|_ the upgrade. If you are not running a |SRC_VERSION|.x version, stop right here! This guide only covers |SRC_VERSION|.x to |NEW_VERSION|.y upgrades.

        There are two alternative upgrade procedures: upgrading ScyllaDB and simultaneously updating 3rd party and OS packages - recommended if you 
        are running a ScyllaDB official image (EC2 AMI, GCP, and Azure images), which is based on Ubuntu 20.04, and upgrading ScyllaDB without updating 
        any external packages.

        **To upgrade ScyllaDB and update 3rd party and OS packages (RECOMMENDED):**

        Choosing this upgrade procedure allows you to upgrade your ScyllaDB version and update the 3rd party and OS packages using one command.

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_DEB_NEW_REPO| to |NEW_VERSION|.

        #. Load the new repo:

            .. code:: sh

               sudo apt-get update

        #. Run the following command to update the manifest file:

            .. code:: sh

               cat scylla-enterprise-packages-<version>-<arch>.txt | sudo xargs -n1 apt-get install -y

            Where:

              * ``<version>`` - The ScyllaDB Enterprise version to which you are upgrading ( |NEW_VERSION| ).
              * ``<arch>`` - Architecture type: ``x86_64`` or ``aarch64``.

            The file is included in the ScyllaDB Enterprise packages downloaded in the previous step. The file location is ``http://downloads.scylladb.com/downloads/scylla/aws/manifest/scylla-packages-<version>-<arch>.txt``

            Example:

                .. code:: sh

                   cat scylla-enterprise-packages-2022.2.0-x86_64.txt | sudo xargs -n1 apt-get install -y


                .. note::

                   Alternatively, you can update the manifest file with the following command:

                   ``sudo apt-get install $(awk '{print $1'} scylla-enterprise-packages-<version>-<arch>.txt) -y``



        To upgrade ScyllaDB without updating any external packages, follow the :ref:`download and installation instructions for Debian/Ubuntu <upgrade-debian-ubuntu-5.1-to-enterprise-2022.2>`.


Start the node
--------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo service scylla-server start

Validate
--------
#. Check cluster status with ``nodetool status`` and make sure **all** nodes, including the one you just upgraded, are in ``UN`` status.
#. Use ``curl -X GET "http://localhost:10000/storage_service/scylla_release_version"`` to check the ScyllaDB version. Validate that the version matches the one you upgraded to.
#. Check scylla-server log (using ``journalctl _COMM=scylla``) and ``/var/log/syslog`` to validate there are no new errors in the log.
#. Check again after two minutes, to validate no new issues are introduced.

Once you are sure the node upgrade was successful, move to the next node in the cluster.

See |Scylla_METRICS|_ for more information.

Rollback Procedure
==================

.. include:: /upgrade/_common/warning_rollback.rst

The following procedure describes a rollback from |SCYLLA_NAME| |NEW_VERSION|.x to |SRC_VERSION|.y. Apply this procedure if an upgrade from |SRC_VERSION| to |NEW_VERSION| failed before completing on all nodes. Use this procedure only for nodes you upgraded to |NEW_VERSION|.

.. warning::

   The rollback procedure can be applied **only** if some nodes have not been upgraded to |NEW_VERSION| yet.
   As soon as the last node in the rolling upgrade procedure is started with |NEW_VERSION|, rollback becomes impossible.
   At that point, the only way to restore a cluster to |SRC_VERSION| is by restoring it from backup.

ScyllaDB rollback is a rolling procedure which does **not** require a full cluster shutdown.
For each of the nodes you rollback to |SRC_VERSION| you will:

* Drain the node and stop ScyllaDB
* Retrieve the old ScyllaDB packages
* Restore the configuration file
* Restore system tables
* Reload systemd configuration
* Restart ScyllaDB
* Validate the rollback success

Apply the following procedure **serially** on each node. Do not move to the next node before validating that the rollback was successful and the node is up and running the old version.

Rollback Steps
==============

Drain and gracefully stop the node
----------------------------------

.. code:: sh

   nodetool drain
   sudo service scylla-server stop

Download and install the old release
------------------------------------

               sudo apt-get remove scylla\* -y
               sudo apt-get install scylla

        Answer ‘y’ to the first two questions.

   .. group-tab:: RHEL/CentOS

        #. Remove the old repo file.

            .. code:: sh

               sudo rm -rf /etc/yum.repos.d/scylla.repo

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_RPM_SRC_REPO|_  to |SRC_VERSION|.
        #. Install:

            .. code:: console

               sudo yum clean all
               sudo yum remove scylla\*
               sudo yum install scylla

   .. group-tab:: EC2/GCP/Azure Ubuntu Image

        #. Remove the old repo file.

            .. code:: sh

               sudo rm -rf /etc/apt/sources.list.d/scylla.list

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_DEB_SRC_REPO| to |SRC_VERSION|.
        #. Install:

            .. code-block::
               
               sudo apt-get update
               sudo apt-get remove scylla\* -y
               sudo apt-get install scylla

        Answer ‘y’ to the first two questions.

Restore the configuration file
------------------------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo rm -rf /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml
   sudo cp -a /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml.backup-src | /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml

Restore system tables
---------------------

Restore all tables of **system** and **system_schema** from the previous snapshot because |NEW_VERSION| uses a different set of system tables. See :doc:`Restore from a Backup and Incremental Backup </operating-scylla/procedures/backup-restore/restore/>` for reference.

.. code:: console

    cd /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/
    sudo find . -maxdepth 1 -type f  -exec sudo rm -f "{}" +
    cd /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/snapshots/<snapshot_name>/
    sudo cp -r * /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/
    sudo chown -R scylla:scylla /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/

Reload systemd configuration
----------------------------

You must reload the unit file if the systemd unit file is changed.

.. code:: sh

   sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start the node
--------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo service scylla-server start

Validate
--------
Check the upgrade instructions above for validation. Once you are sure the node rollback is successful, move to the next node in the cluster.
