=======================
Generate a cqlshrc File 
=======================

Making connections to a Scylla cluster that uses SSL can be a tricky process, but it doesn't diminish the importance of properly securing your client connections with SSL. This is especially needed when you are connecting to your cluster via the Internet or an untrusted network.

Prerequisites
--------------

Install the Java Cryptography Extensions. You can download the extensions from `Oracle <https://www.oracle.com/>`_. The extension must match your installed Java version. Once downloaded, extract the contents of the archive to the ``lib/security`` subdirectory of your JRE installation directory ``/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/security/14``.

Procedure
----------

#. Create a new cqlsh configuration file at ``~/.cassandra/cqlshrc``, using the template below.

   .. code-block:: console

         [authentication]
         username = myusername
         password = mypassword
         [cql]
         version = 3.3.1
         [connection]
         hostname = 127.0.0.1
         port = 9042
         factory = cqlshlib.ssl.ssl_transport_factory
         [ssl]
         certfile = path/to/rootca.crt
         validate = true
         userkey = client_key.key
         usercert = client_cert.crt_signed

   The ``[ssl]`` section of the above template applies to a CA signed certificate. If you are using 
   :doc:`a self-signed certificate </operating-scylla/security/generate-certificate/>`, the ``[ssl]`` section will 
   resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: console

     [ssl]
     certfile = /etc/scylla/db.crt
     validate = true
     userkey = /etc/scylla/db.key
     usercert = /etc/scylla/db.crt

   .. note::
     * If ``validate = true``, the certificate name must match the machine's hostname.
     * If using client authentication (``require_client_auth = true`` in ``cassandra.yaml``), you also need to point to 
       your userkey and usercert. SSL client authentication is only supported via cqlsh on C* 2.1 and later.


      
#. Change the following parameters:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 33 33 33
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Parameter name
        - Description
        - Acceptable Values / Notes
      * - username
        - Your username 
        - This requires password authentication to be set and roles to be created. 
      * - password
        - The password that is associated with the username you specified.
        - This requires password authentication to be set and roles to be created. 
      * - version
        - CQL version that the cluster you are connecting to is using
        - If you are not sure run ``nodetool version``
      * - certfile
        - Root certificate that was used to sign file specified with the ``usercert`` patameter
        - Applies to CA signed certificates
      * - userkey
        - Key certificate used for ``cqlsh``
        - 
      * - usercert
        - Signed security certificate to use when connecting to a node using ``cqlsh``
        - 
     
#. Save your changes. Connect to the node using ``cqlsh --ssl``. If the configuration settings were saved correctly, you will be able to connect. 

#. Run Cassandra Stress to generate required files and to connect to the SSL cluster. Supply the URL of the SSH node, and the path to your certificates. In addition supply the credentials associated with the certificate. The truststore file is the Java keystore containing the clusterâ€™s SSL certificates. For example:

   .. code-block:: none
   
      $> cassandra-stress write -node 127.0.0.1 -transport truststore=/path/to/cluster/truststore.jks truststore-password=mytruststorepassword -mode native cql3 user=username password=mypassword

   Cassandra stress will generate some files, you will need these to configure client - node encryption in-transit.
